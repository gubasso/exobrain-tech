# Branch Protection & CI-Driven Release — Workflow

Specification for protecting `master`, restricting development to `develop`, and promoting to
`master` **only** via CI on a semver tag.

> The abstract branch/release **model** (why `develop` integrates, why `master` is CI-promoted, the
> release-PR pattern) lives in the general shelf
> [tech/programming/release-workflow/](../../../programming/release-workflow/). This document is the
> platform **enforcement** layer — how to apply the rulesets/protections on GitHub and GitLab.

Apply it (pick one per platform):

- **Scripted** — `github/setup.sh` (reads `OWNER_REPO`) or `gitlab/setup.sh` (reads `PROJECT`,
  `TIER`). One run per new project; see [README](./README.md#usage).
- **Point-and-click** — [github-web-ui](./github-web-ui.md) / [gitlab-web-ui](./gitlab-web-ui.md).

Required CI status checks are **not** baked into the rulesets — pass `REQUIRED_CHECKS`
(comma-separated contexts matching the job names your CI emits) to `github/setup.sh`. If unset, no
status-check rule is added. GitLab gates on the pipeline itself, not named checks.

## Strategy

- `master` — release branch. **No human writes.** Only the CI service actor pushes, triggered by a
  semver tag on `develop`.
- `develop` — integration branch. Feature branches merge here via PR/MR with review + green CI.
- Feature branches — short-lived, merged into `develop`.
- Release — maintainer tags `vX.Y.Z` on `develop` → CI verifies ancestry → fast-forwards `master` to
  the tag → publishes the release.

## Core concepts

### Bypass actor / allowed pusher

The only identity that may write to `master`. Use a GitHub App, `github-actions[bot]`, or a GitLab
Project Access Token. **Never a human user.**

- GitHub: `github-actions[bot]` is the default (app id **15368**).
- GitHub, for CI-on-`master`-after-promotion: use a GitHub App token — pushes via `GITHUB_TOKEN` do
  **not** retrigger workflows.
- GitLab Premium/Ultimate: allow-list the bot user of a Project Access Token.
- GitLab Free: relies on the CI job-token push toggle (17.2+) or a Deploy Token — it cannot restrict
  push to a specific user.

### Tag protection

If anyone can push a `v*` tag, anyone can trigger a release. Protect tags too — restrict
create/delete/update to maintainers (or CI).

### Linear history

Required on `master` so CI can only fast-forward. Matches the "promote to the tag" model: no merge
commits, no rewrites.

## Prerequisites

- Repo admin / Maintainer access.
- CI has run at least once so required status-check names exist.
- Bypass actor / service identity exists **before** you turn protection on — otherwise `master`
  becomes unreleasable.
- For CLI runbooks: `gh` / `glab` authenticated, `jq` installed.

## Local guardrail (optional)

Add `master` to the `no-commit-to-branch` hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` so accidental local
commits fail before they reach the remote:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
  hooks:
    - id: no-commit-to-branch
      args: [--branch, master]
```

## Platform notes (2026)

### GitHub

- **Repository Rulesets** (GA) is the recommended path, replacing the legacy branch-protection API.
- `gh` CLI is read-only for rulesets (`gh ruleset {list,view,check}`); create/update goes through
  `gh api`.
- Pushes using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` do **not** trigger further workflow runs. If `master`
  needs CI on promotion, mint a GitHub App token via `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` and put
  that App in the ruleset's bypass list.

### GitLab

- `glab` has no `protected-branches` subcommand. All protection config goes through `glab api`.
- Per-user `allowed_to_push` / `allowed_to_merge` require **Premium/Ultimate**. Free tier uses
  coarse access-level enums and must rely on the CI job-token push toggle (17.2+) or a Deploy Token.
- Access-level integers: `0`=No one, `30`=Developer, `40`=Maintainer, `60`=Admin.
- **Branch rules** (Settings → Repository → Branch rules) is the new unified UI superseding
  **Protected branches**. Both paths still work in 18.x; this set of runbooks uses Protected
  branches because its form is fully stable.

## Caveats

- A release tag pushed on a commit that is not an ancestor of `develop` must be rejected by the
  promotion job — never skip the ancestry check.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger downstream workflows. If `master` has its own CI that must run on
  promotion, use a GitHub App token instead.
- GitLab Free cannot restrict push to a specific user. The only "only CI can push" path there is the
  17.2+ job-token toggle.

## Verification checklist

Run after applying protection on either platform:

1. As a regular user, `git push origin master` — must be rejected.
2. Open a PR/MR from a feature branch directly to `master` — blocked.
3. Open a PR/MR to `develop` without required approvals — merge disabled.
4. Tag `v0.0.1-test` on `develop` — release job runs, `master` advances to the tag, release is
   published.
5. Tag `v0.0.2-test` on a commit **not** on `develop` — ancestry check fails, `master` stays put.
6. Delete the test tags and reset `master` on a scratch repo before trusting the flow in production.
