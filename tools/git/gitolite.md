## Dictionary

- **workstation:** my personal computer a.k.a. client
- **server:** vps/remote server
- **hosting user:** This is the user whose name goes into the repo URLs your users will be cloning,
  for example
  - `ssh://git@server/repo`
  - `git@server:repo`
  - Usually, this is `git`
- **logical repo name**: within the conf file
  - logical repo name `foo` will be `$HOME/repositories/foo.git`
  - `bar/baz`-> `$HOME/repositories/bar/baz.git`
- **ref:** branch or tag
- **refex:** a regex that matches a ref

## Installation[^2]

- enter server as your user admin, sudo, root...

  - any user (`sysking`, `admin`, `your_name`)

- install dependencies[^4]

  - git perl rsync
  - openssh

- install packages:

  - ubuntu/debian: `gitolite3`
  - arch: `gitolite`

## Setup

### SSHD Config

- Make sure server has `UsePAM yes`
- SSH server can not be configured with `AllowGroup` option.

See server-vps security steps (path: `../../infra/server-vps/server-vps.md#security-steps`)

### Gitolite user

After install, check if user `git` or `gitolite` is already created. If not create `git` user[^1]:

```sh
sudo useradd -m git -s /bin/bash
```

- in archlinux: user `gitolite` already created
- this user is a dedicated userid to host the repos
- this user id does NOT currently have any ssh pubkey-based access
- ideally, this user id has shell access ONLY by `su - git` from some other userid on the same
  server (this ensure minimal confusion for ssh newbies!)

### Basic Checks

Login as \<gitolite_user>:

```sh
sudo su - git
# or
sudo su - gitolite
```

Check if `gitolite` is in PATH:

```sh
which gitolite
```

At `server:/home/git`, make sure these files/dirs do not exists:

- `~/.gitolite.rc`
- `~/.gitolite`
- `~/repositories`
- `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### Authorize gitolite admin

- from <workstation>: copy my local user_pub_key to -> `server:/home/git`
  - this user_pub_key is my local user, that will be the gitolite admin
  - `<user_admin>.pub` : has to have the name of user that will be the gitolite admin

```
scp yourkey.pub git@yourserver.tld:˜/yourname.pub
# or
rsync -vurzP yourkey.pub git@yourserver.tld:˜/yourname.pub
```

- The next step is important. Ensure that your `/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys` file is empty.

Finally, setup gitolite with yourself as the administrator:

- at server
- as \<git_user> (or hosting user) `su - git`

```
$HOME/bin/gitolite setup -pk YourName.pub
```

## Admin Tasks

Basic administration is done within `gitolite-admin` repo.

- At workstation

```
git clone git@host:gitolite-admin
```

After changing anything in local `gitolite-admin` repo, add/commit changes and push.

Management will be executed in push. E.g.:

- gitolite will add the new users to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server
- create a new, empty, repo called "foo".

---

```
gitolite help
```

- If you have shell on the server, you have a lot more commands available to you

### adding users and repos[^3]

Do NOT add new repos or users manually on the server.

#### Users: Add new users

Copy `<user>.pub` to `gitolite-admin/keydir`

[multiple keys per user](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin#multiple-keys-per-user)

- `keydir/alice.pub`
  - = `keydir/home/alice.pub`
  - = `keydir/laptop/alice.pub`

[appendix 2: old style multi-keys](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin#appendix-2-old-style-multi-keys)

#### Users: Remove a user

```
git rm keydir/alice.pub
```

- Commit and push the changes

#### Repos: Create new repos and manage users access

Users must have been already added to `keydir`

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
repo foo
    RW+         =   alice
    RW          =   bob
    R           =   carol
```

- multiple repos with same access rules

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
repo foo bar
    RW+         =   alice
```

- multiple with repo group

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@myrepos    =   foo
@myrepos    =   bar
    .
    .
    .
@myrepos    =   zzq

repo @myrepos
    RW+     =   alice
```

- Reponames can contain `/` characters (this allows you to put your repos in a tree-structure for
  convenience).

---

include files

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
include "foo.conf"
```

- You can also use a glob (`include "*.conf"`), or put your include files into subdirectories of
  "conf" (`include "foo/bar.conf"`), or both (`include "repos/*.conf"`).

#### Repos: Add existing repo (Migrate repository)

[Gitolite: appendix 1: bringing existing repos into gitolite](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin#appendix-1-bringing-existing-repos-into-gitolite)

#### Repos: Moving servers

[moving servers](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/install#moving-servers)

#### Repos: removing/renaming remove/delete a repo

- https://gitolite.com/gitolite/basic-admin#removingrenaming-a-repo

**removing**

- Remove repo block from `conf/gitolite.conf`
- Commit and push it
- Login to server
- delete repo from `$HOME/repositories`

**renaming**

- Go to the server and rename the repo at the Unix command line. Don't forget to retain the ".git"
  extension on the directory name.
- Change the name in the conf/gitolite.conf file in your gitolite-admin repo clone, and
  add/commit/push.

### Access Rules

- Full rules at: [Gitolite: access rules](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/conf#access-rules)

#### Basic example

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
repo foo
    RW+                     =   alice
    -   master              =   bob
    -   refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   bob
    RW                      =   bob
    RW  refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   carol
    R                       =   dave
```

- alice can do anything to any branch or tag -- create, push, delete, rewind/overwrite etc.
- bob can create or fast-forward push any branch whose name does not start with "master" and create
  any tag whose name does not start with "v"+digit.
- carol can create tags whose names start with "v"+digit.
- dave can clone/fetch.

### Groups

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@staff      =   alice bob carol
@interns    =   ashok

repo secret
    RW      =   @staff

repo foss
    RW+     =   @staff
    RW      =   @interns
```

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@developers     =   dilbert alice wally
@foss-repos     =   git gitolite

repo @foss-repos
    RW+         =   @developers
```

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
repo foo bar

    RW+                     =   alice @teamleads
    -   master              =   dilbert @devteam
    -   refs/tags/v[0-9]    =   dilbert @devteam
    RW+ dev/                =   dilbert @devteam
    RW                      =   dilbert @devteam
    R                       =   @managers
```

---

- Group lists accumulate.

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@staff      =   alice bob carol
@developers     =   dilbert alice wally
```

is equal to:

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@staff      =   alice bob
@staff      =   carol
```

---

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@developers     =   dilbert alice
@interns        =   ashok
@staff          =   @interns @developers
@developers     =   wally

# wally is NOT part of @staff
```

---

- You can also use group names in other group names:

**`conf/gitolite.conf`**

```
@all-devs   =   @staff @interns
```

---

- `@all` is a special group name that is often convenient to use if you really mean "all repos" or
  "all users".

## Normal Usage (project/normal user)

Get server infos:

```
ssh git@host info
```

Help with commands:

```
ssh git@host help
```

- All commands respond to a single argument of "-h" with suitable information.

---

E.g.: Bob wants to clone and work in a repo he's added and authorized. In Bob's workstation:

```
git clone git@host:foo
```

- NOTE: again, if they are asked for a password, something is wrong.

## Advanced Cases

- ["non-core" gitolite](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/non-core)

- Commands can be run from the shell command line. Among those, the ones in the ENABLE list in the
  rc file can also be run remotely.

- Hooks are standard git hooks.

- Sugar scripts change the conf language for your convenience. The word sugar comes from "syntactic
  sugar".

- Triggers are to gitolite what hooks are to git. I just chose a different name to avoid confusion
  and constant disambiguation in the docs.

- VREFs are extensions to the access control check part of gitolite.
