## hooks

## Commands

### Merge branches (one-liner)

The easiest option is to merge the target branch (e.g. `develop`) into the feature branch using
something like the following:

```sh
git checkout feature
git merge develop
```

Or, you can condense this to a one-liner:

```sh
git merge feature develop
```

### Checkout vs Switch

- [What's the difference between git switch and git checkout branch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57265785/whats-the-difference-between-git-switch-and-git-checkout-branch)
  - Command comparison

## Branches

[Show git ahead and behind info for all branches, including remotes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7773939/show-git-ahead-and-behind-info-for-all-branches-including-remotes)

```sh
git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:short) %(upstream:track) %(upstream:remotename)" refs/heads
```

### Clone and switch to a branch

```sh
git checkout -b new-branch-name origin/new-branch-name
```

You can do it in one shot with `git`—create the local branch **with the same name** and set it to
track the remote branch.

Assuming the remote is `origin` and the branch is `my-feature`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b my-feature origin/my-feature
```

That:

- creates local branch `my-feature`
- sets its upstream to `origin/my-feature` (so `git pull`/`git push` work without extra args)

---

On newer Git, there’s also this shorter form:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch --track origin/my-feature
```

If the local branch doesn’t exist yet, this will:

- create a local `my-feature`
- automatically track `origin/my-feature`

You can confirm they’re associated with:

```bash
git status
# or
git branch -vv
```

### Rename a branch

- [Git Rename Branch – Learn How to Rename a Local and Remote Git Branch](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-rename-a-git-branch/#How_to_Rename_a_Local_Git_Branch)

Rename local branch:

```sh
git checkout old-name
git branch -m new-name
# or
git checkout master
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

Rename remote branch:

```sh
# deleting and creating new
git push origin --delete old-name
git push origin -u new-name
# or by by overwriting it
git push origin :old-name new-name
git push origin –u new-name
```

### Delete branches

delete branches multiple

- [Delete multiple remote branches in git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10555136/delete-multiple-remote-branches-in-git)

```sh
git branch -r | awk -F/ '/\/PREFIX/{print $2}' | xargs -I {} git push origin :{}
```

Clean branches fetched from other (remotes) repositories:

```sh
git remote update --prune
```

## Merge / Diff conflicts

### Merge just a file/path from another branch

merge file / merge path / merge dir

[How can I selectively merge or pick changes from another branch in Git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/449541/how-can-i-selectively-merge-or-pick-changes-from-another-branch-in-git)

tldr;

```sh
git checkout source_branch -- path/to/file
# resolve conflicts if any
git commit -am '...'
```

### merge from stash

- [How to resolve git stash conflict without commit?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7751555/how-to-resolve-git-stash-conflict-without-commit)

```sh
git restore --staged <file>...
git restore --staged .
```

## Development & release workflow

The canonical branch model and release process — `develop` integrates, `master` holds releases, and
CI promotes on a tag — now lives in the general shelf. This README keeps only the git command
mechanics; the workflow model and its per-language bindings are documented there:

- [Development & release workflow — general principles](../../programming/release-workflow/) — the
  `develop`/`master` branch model, the automated release-PR pattern, and Trusted Publishing / OIDC.
- [branch-protection/](./branch-protection/) — the platform runbooks and rulesets that **enforce**
  the model (GitHub Rulesets / GitLab protected branches, bypass actor, tag protection).
- [feature-lifecycle.md](feature-lifecycle.md) + [rebase-workflow.md](rebase-workflow.md) — the
  day-to-day feature-branch loop that feeds `develop`.

- merge branch logic:

  - checkout the branch where you want to bring the commit
  - just as a remote (github): I'm working in my local, checked out, and run git remote to bring the
    changes from outside repos

- if you decide to quit the merge: `git merge --abort`

  - if you have already committed, to rollback and erase last commit, run:
    `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD`
