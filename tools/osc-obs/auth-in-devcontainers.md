# osc / OBS authentication inside a dctl devcontainer

How to make `osc` (the openSUSE Build Service CLI) authenticate cleanly from inside a
[dctl](https://github.com/devcontainerctl)-managed devcontainer, without weakening the host setup
and without relying on graphical keyrings that don't exist inside the container.

> Audience: anyone running `osc` from inside a devcontainer where the host already has a working
> interactive `osc` setup (typically backed by KWallet / GNOME Keyring / similar).
>
> Scope: this doc targets the **public openSUSE OBS instance** (`https://api.opensuse.org` /
> `https://build.opensuse.org`). For SUSE's internal IBS or a self-hosted OBS instance with SSH-key
> auth enabled, see the "Future / SUSE IBS only" section near the end.

## Why this needs a deliberate setup

`osc` reads its config from `~/.config/osc/oscrc`. Each API URL gets its own section:

```ini
[https://api.opensuse.org]
user = <obs-username>
credentials_mgr_class = osc.credentials.KeyringCredentialsManager:keyring.backends.kwallet.DBusKeyring
```

The host usually pins a `credentials_mgr_class` that delegates to a **graphical keyring** (KWallet
via D-Bus, GNOME Secret Service, etc.). Inside a typical devcontainer there is **no D-Bus session,
no Secret Service daemon, and no graphical keyring**, so `osc` fails at startup with:

```text
Unable to instantiate creds mgr (section: https://api.opensuse.org)
Please enter new credentials.
```

This happens before any network call — `import keyring` blows up during module load. The
`--no-keyring` / `--no-gnome-keyring` flags do _not_ help, because keyring is imported before
argparse runs ([osc#785](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/issues/785)).

The fix is **not** "downgrade the host backend". It is "give the container its own osc
configuration, selected per-environment".

### Why not SSH-key auth?

The natural ask is "use SSH-key auth — no password on disk at all". On the public
`build.opensuse.org` instance, this is **not currently viable** (as of 2026-06):

- The feature request,
  [openSUSE/open-build-service#7842](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/7842),
  has been open since July 2019 with no assignee, no merged PR, and no milestone.
- Server-side SSH `Signature` auth (the `ssh-keygen -Y sign` flow) is deployed only on **SUSE's
  internal IBS** (`build.suse.de`), per the
  [SUSE Communities MFA article](https://www.suse.com/c/multi-factor-authentication-on-suses-build-service/)
  (June 2025). That article explicitly notes the public OBS doesn't have it yet.
- There is **no "SSH Public Keys" UI** in the user profile on `build.opensuse.org`. The "Tokens"
  page that does exist is for **OBS application tokens** — a completely different feature (see Tier
  3 below).
- The `osc` client _does_ support `sshkey =` in oscrc since
  [osc#1083](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/pull/1083) (July 2022), but the option is only
  meaningful when the _server_ accepts `Signature` auth. Against `build.opensuse.org` it silently
  degrades to (or fails at) password auth.

Re-evaluate this section when #7842 closes or the SUSE OBS team announces SSH-key auth on the public
instance.

## Decision matrix

`osc`'s `oscrc` is keyed by _apiurl_, not by a free-form profile name. You cannot have two
`[https://api.opensuse.org]` sections in the same file with different backends. The escape hatch is
`OSC_CONFIG` (env var) or `--config` (CLI flag), which selects an alternative `oscrc` file. Build on
that.

Ranked for the **public `build.opensuse.org`** instance:

Tier 1 is the primary path covered below. Tier 2 is a small variation. Tier 3 is a useful supplement
for trigger-only verbs but never a replacement. Tier 4 is documented for completeness and for
readers on IBS / self-hosted OBS. Tier 5 is mentioned only to be ruled out.

---

## Prerequisites

- `osc` installed inside the container image (typically from the distro repos via zypper).
- The container user's UID matches the host user's UID (so bind-mounted files have the right
  ownership). dctl does this by default.
- dctl is configured to compose `devcontainer.json` from layered fragments (base → tool image →
  per-project leaf), so you have a leaf layer you can edit.
- An OBS account on the target instance (this guide assumes `https://api.opensuse.org`).

You'll be touching files in three places:

| Path (host-side)                                                                  | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${HOME}/.config/osc-container/oscrc`                                             | Container-only `oscrc`, never read on the host            |
| `<dctl-config-root>/devcontainer/<project>/devcontainer.json`                     | Project leaf layer: declares the mount + `OSC_CONFIG` env |
| (optional, Tier 2) the same `oscrc` with a different `credentials_mgr_class` line | Use plaintext instead of obfuscated                       |

The host's existing `~/.config/osc/oscrc` is **not modified**.

---

## Tier 1 — Obfuscated password in a container-only oscrc (recommended)

`ObfuscatedConfigFileCredentialsManager` stores the password as `base64(bz2(plaintext))` directly in
the oscrc file — no keyring, no D-Bus, no graphical session needed. It works headless and survives
container recreates because the file is mounted from the host.

**Important up-front:** "obfuscated" is _not_ encryption. Anyone with read access to the file can
recover the password. Treat the file itself as a secret of the same sensitivity as the password. The
steps below assume:

- File permissions `600` on the host (tight enough that only your user can read it).
- A bind mount that is **read-only** so the container cannot corrupt the file.
- Either an OBS account / sub-account dedicated to the container, or a password that is **not
  reused** for any other service. The blast radius if the file leaks is "full authority of whatever
  OBS identity it holds", so keep that identity narrow.
- A rotation discipline (calendar reminder, password manager note, whatever you use elsewhere).
  Rotate immediately if the host or any backup is ever exposed.

### Step 1. Create the container-only oscrc directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/osc-container
chmod 700 ~/.config/osc-container
```

The directory lives **outside** `~/.config/osc/` so the host's regular `osc` tooling doesn't pick it
up by accident.

### Step 2. Write the container-only oscrc

```ini
# ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc

[general]
apiurl = <obs-api-url>

[<obs-api-url>]
user = <obs-username>
credentials_mgr_class = osc.credentials.ObfuscatedConfigFileCredentialsManager
```

Placeholders:

- `<obs-api-url>` — e.g. `https://api.opensuse.org` for the public openSUSE OBS, or your self-hosted
  OBS instance.
- `<obs-username>` — your OBS account (or dedicated sub-account) username.

Note: `pass =` is intentionally absent at this stage. Step 3 appends it in obfuscated form. (Older
copies of this doc said "`osc` will write it back on first interactive use" — that interactive flow
no longer works on current osc; see Troubleshooting.)

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc
```

### Step 3. Seed the obfuscated password once, on the host

Compute the obfuscated `pass =` line in pure Python and append it to the oscrc. The format
(`base64(bz2(password.encode("ascii")))`, stored under the `pass` key) matches what
`ObfuscatedConfigFileCredentialsManager` writes itself — verified against
[`osc/credentials.py`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/blob/master/osc/credentials.py).

```bash
python3 -c '
import base64, bz2, getpass
p = getpass.getpass("OBS password: ")
print("pass =", base64.b64encode(bz2.compress(p.encode("ascii"))).decode("ascii"))
' >> ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc

chmod 600 ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc
```

The one-liner is stdlib-only and intentionally inline so this doc stays portable — no external
script or repo required. If you prefer a named tool, lift the body of the one-liner into
`~/.local/bin/obfuscate-osc-password`, `chmod +x`, then:

```bash
obfuscate-osc-password >> ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc
chmod 600 ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc
```

Either way, the helper / one-liner never touches the oscrc itself — it just prints the
`pass = <blob>` line for you to redirect. This keeps the secret out of any script's process memory
beyond the duration of one stdout write.

Verify the file now has all three relevant lines:

```bash
grep -E '^(user|pass|credentials_mgr_class)' ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc
```

You should see `user=…`, `pass=…` (an opaque base64+bz2 blob), and `credentials_mgr_class=…`.

> **Never commit the seeded oscrc to any repo (dotfiles included).** The obfuscation is reversible
> by anyone with read access to the file. Treat the seeded oscrc the same way you treat a plaintext
> password file: live only on the host, mode `600`, owner-only dir, rotated on a calendar, and
> explicitly out of every version-control tree.

> [Troubleshooting entry below](#typeerror-object-of-type-nonetype-has-no-len-during-seed). The
> Python pre-seed above bypasses the broken interactive path.

### Step 3b. Pre-create `~/.config/osc/` in the container image (uid-owned)

Skip this step **only** if you already know the container image pre-creates `~/.config/osc/` owned
by your uid. If you're not sure, do it anyway — it's idempotent.

When a bind-mount target path does not exist inside the image, Docker auto-creates the parent
directory at `docker create` time. That auto-creation runs as **root** and produces a
`root:root 0755` directory. On the first HTTPS call, `osc`'s
[`TrustedCertStore.__init__`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/blob/master/osc/oscssl.py) runs
`os.makedirs("~/.config/osc/trusted-certs", mode=0o700)` as the container user — which fails with
`PermissionError: [Errno 13]` on the now-root-owned parent.

Fix: have your image's Dockerfile pre-create the directory as the container user, so Docker's
bind-mount auto-create has nothing to do:

```dockerfile
# In your devcontainer / agents image Dockerfile, before any USER swap
# back to root (i.e. while $USERNAME is the target uid):
RUN install -d -m 0755 -o $USERNAME -g $USERNAME \
        /home/$USERNAME/.config/osc
```

This must happen at **image build time**. A live-running container cannot fix it: `dctl ws reup` /
`docker compose up --force-recreate` only recreates the container against the existing image and
will hit the same Docker auto-mkdir-as-root path. After editing the Dockerfile, do a no-cache
rebuild (e.g. `dctl image build --full-rebuild`) and then recreate the container.

Diagnostic for "is the running image actually built with the pre-create?":
`stat -c 'Birth=%w' ~/.config/osc` inside the container. Birth time at image-build timestamp → baked
in correctly. Birth time at container-start timestamp → still missing from the image; rebuild.

### Step 4. Wire it into the dctl leaf layer

Edit your project's devcontainer leaf layer (path varies — typical locations are
`<dctl-config-root>/devcontainer/<project>/devcontainer.json`, or a
`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` inside the project repo):

```json
{
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.config/osc-container/oscrc,target=${containerEnv:HOME}/.config/osc/oscrc,type=bind,readonly"
  ],
  "containerEnv": {
    "OSC_CONFIG": "${containerEnv:HOME}/.config/osc/oscrc"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- The mount maps the container-only file onto the **standard** in-container location
  (`~/.config/osc/oscrc`). Scripts that don't know about `OSC_CONFIG` still work via the default
  file lookup.
- `OSC_CONFIG` is belt-and-braces — explicit and discoverable in `env | grep OSC`.
- The mount is `readonly`. This is safe because Step 3 already wrote the obfuscated `pass =` line;
  nothing the container does needs to modify the oscrc.
- If you previously had a 1:1 mount of `~/.config/osc` from the host (e.g. to ride on the host's
  keyring backend), **remove that mount entry** — the new one replaces it.

### Step 5. Rebuild the container and verify

From the host, recreate the container so the new mount takes effect:

```bash
# dctl-specific recreate command — varies by version
dctl ws reup
```

Inside the container:

```bash
# 1. OSC_CONFIG is set, and points to the bind-mounted file.
echo "$OSC_CONFIG"

# 2. The file is visible and has the expected backend.
grep -E 'credentials_mgr_class|user|pass' ~/.config/osc/oscrc

# 3. The bind-mount parent dir is owned by your uid (not root).
#    If it is root-owned, osc's first HTTPS call will crash trying to
#    create `trusted-certs/` — see the matching Troubleshooting entry.
stat -c '%U:%G %a' ~/.config/osc
# → <your-user>:<your-group> 755

# 4. Auth round-trips to OBS.
osc -A <obs-api-url> api /person/<obs-username> >/dev/null && echo OK

# 5. The first successful HTTPS call created `trusted-certs/` under
#    your uid. Empty contents are NORMAL — it only fills up when you
#    answer `2` to an interactive trust prompt for a self-signed /
#    non-CA-signed cert. CA-signed endpoints (e.g. api.opensuse.org)
#    legitimately leave it empty forever.
ls -ld ~/.config/osc/trusted-certs
# → drwx------ ... <your-user> <your-group> ...
```

The auth check (`api /person/<user>`) is the canonical scripted verifier: it's read-only, fully
non-interactive, requires authentication (unlike `/about` or `/configuration` which are often public
on OBS), exits 0 on success, and 401s cleanly on bad creds.

---

## Tier 2 — Plaintext password in a container-only oscrc (fallback)

If for some reason `ObfuscatedConfigFileCredentialsManager` doesn't work on your `osc` version, use
`PlaintextConfigFileCredentialsManager` instead. Everything else (Steps 1, 3–5) is identical. Only
the oscrc content differs:

```ini
# ~/.config/osc-container/oscrc

[general]
apiurl = <obs-api-url>

[<obs-api-url>]
user = <obs-username>
pass = <obs-password>
credentials_mgr_class = osc.credentials.PlaintextConfigFileCredentialsManager
```

Here you write the `pass =` line yourself (no seeding step needed).

Tier 2's only difference from Tier 1 is whether the password is recoverable from the file by `grep`
(plaintext) or `base64 -d | bunzip2` (obfuscated). Same blast radius if the file leaks — apply the
same security caveats from Tier 1.

---

## Tier 3 — OBS application tokens (supplementary)

The "Manage Your Tokens" page in your OBS profile creates
[application tokens](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha-obs-authorization-token).
They have desirable properties:

- Scoped per package.
- Revocable from the web UI without touching your password.
- No `credentials_mgr_class` complications — authenticated via HTTP Basic with the token as the
  password.

But they only authorize a narrow set of **trigger** operations: `rebuild`, `release`, `runservice`,
and `workflow`. They **cannot** be used for `branch`, `co`, `ci`, `buildinfo`, `buildlog`, `meta`,
etc. — i.e. anything that reads or writes source, browses build state, or manipulates project
metadata.

So tokens are useful when:

- You have a CI / automation flow that only triggers rebuilds, OR
- You want a _second_ identity (alongside Tier 1) whose authority is narrowly scoped for one
  specific automated action.

They do not replace Tier 1 for a general `osc` workflow.

---

## Tier 4 — SSH-key auth (future / SUSE IBS only — NOT on public OBS)

Documented for readers on SUSE's internal IBS or on a self-hosted OBS instance with SSH `Signature`
auth enabled.

The shape mirrors Tier 1, but with:

```ini
[<obs-api-url>]
user = <obs-username>
sshkey = ~/.ssh/<obs-container-key>
credentials_mgr_class = osc.credentials.TransientCredentialsManager
```

…plus an extra read-only mount for the private key:

```json
"source=${localEnv:HOME}/.ssh/<obs-container-key>,target=${containerEnv:HOME}/.ssh/<obs-container-key>,type=bind,readonly"
```

Public key is registered in the OBS web UI (where supported) or via the OBS REST API.
`TransientCredentialsManager` is the lightest backend that satisfies the config schema without
touching any keyring; with `sshkey =` set, `osc` never asks it for a password.

**Do not enable this against `build.opensuse.org`** until
[#7842](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/issues/7842) is closed and the feature is
deployed. It will silently fall back to (or fail at) password auth.

---

## Tier 5 — Forward host D-Bus / Secret Service (avoid)

You can mount the host's D-Bus user session socket into the container to reuse the host keyring.
This is mentioned only to be ruled out — it requires `--privileged` or extra capabilities, trusts
the host's uid, is fragile across host/container user-id mismatches, and substantially expands the
container's attack surface. Tier 1 achieves the same end (auth works in the container) without any
of those costs.

---

## What about just changing the host?

Don't. If you swap the host's `credentials_mgr_class` from a keyring backend to obfuscated or
plaintext, you've made the **host** strictly less safe to fix a container-side problem. The
container-only-oscrc approach above:

- Leaves the host's keyring-backed setup intact.
- Confines any obfuscated or plaintext secret to a single file with one purpose.
- Lets you revoke the container's authority (rotate the dedicated password, or revoke the dedicated
  sub-account) without touching the host's main credentials.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `Unable to instantiate creds mgr (section: …)`

The oscrc the container is reading still names a keyring backend. Check, from inside the container:

```bash
echo "$OSC_CONFIG"
grep -E 'credentials_mgr_class|user|pass' "$OSC_CONFIG"
```

The `credentials_mgr_class` line must be either
`osc.credentials.ObfuscatedConfigFileCredentialsManager` or
`osc.credentials.PlaintextConfigFileCredentialsManager`. **Never a `KeyringCredentialsManager`
variant inside a container**, unless you've explicitly gone the Tier 5 route (forwarded a Secret
Service / KWallet socket — not recommended).

If the wrong file is being read, suspect:

- `OSC_CONFIG` not exported in the container environment.
- The bind mount target path doesn't match where `osc` looks (i.e. the file in `~/.config/osc/oscrc`
  is still an old image-baked copy).

### `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` during seed

Symptom: running `osc -A <apiurl> api /person/<user>` against a pass-less oscrc (the "let osc prompt
and write back" flow that older versions of this doc described) crashes before reaching the prompt:

```text
File ".../osc/connection.py", line 652, in __init__
    self.basic_auth_password = self._get_password()
  File ".../collections/__init__.py", line 1413, in __len__
    return len(self.data)
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

Root cause (current osc, e.g. Tumbleweed / python3.13):

1. `ObfuscatedConfigFileCredentialsManager.get_password()` finds no stored `pass`/`passx` and
   returns a `conf.Password(None)` wrapper.
2. `connection.py:652` calls `bool()` on that wrapper.
3. `conf.Password` is a `UserString` subclass with no `__bool__`, so Python falls back to `__len__`
   → `len(self.data)` → `len(None)` → `TypeError`.

This is distinct from the earlier fix in [osc#1083](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/pull/1083) and
is not yet patched upstream. The fix is to **not run the interactive osc seed** — use the Python
pre-seed in Tier 1 Step 3, which writes the obfuscated `pass =` line directly and bypasses the
broken code path.

### `osc` re-prompts every run after seeding

If you previously used the (now-removed) interactive seed flow with a read-only-mounted oscrc, osc
couldn't write the obfuscated `pass =` line back, so it re-prompted every run. Re-do Tier 1 Step 3
with the Python pre-seed against a writable oscrc, then re-mount read-only.

### `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '.../osc/trusted-certs'`

Symptom: the first `osc … api /person/<user>` call (or any other HTTPS-against-OBS call) crashes
before sending the request:

```text
File ".../osc/oscssl.py", line 56, in __init__
    os.makedirs(self.dir_path, mode=0o700)
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/<user>/.config/osc/trusted-certs'
```

Root cause: `~/.config/osc/` is owned by `root:root` (mode 0755). Inside a bind-mount-based
devcontainer this almost always means Docker auto-created the parent for your bind-mounted `oscrc`
at `docker create` time, because the image didn't already have it. `osc` then can't `mkdir`
`trusted-certs/` underneath as your uid.

Diagnostic:

```bash
stat -c '%U:%G %a  Birth=%w' ~/.config/osc
# Birth = container-start time → image is missing the pre-create.
# Birth = (older) image-build time → image is fine, look elsewhere.
```

Fix: do **Step 3b** above. The `trusted-certs/` path is hard-coded in osc (only `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
can relocate it), so the only durable fix is making the parent uid-owned in the image.
Live-container workarounds:

- `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.config/osc` — only works if your container actually has unrestricted
  sudo. Most hardened devcontainer bases (incl. dctl's `agents`) limit `NOPASSWD` to specific
  binaries like `zypper`, so this typically fails.
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.local/state/osc-xdg osc …` — relocates the cert store outside the
  bind-mount parent. Unblocks one-off work, but leaks XDG redirection onto every other XDG-aware
  tool in that shell. Treat as triage only.

Both workarounds are temporary. Ship the Step 3b Dockerfile pre-create and rebuild.

### `~/.config/osc/trusted-certs/` is empty — is something wrong?

No. The directory is osc's **trust-on-first-use store for non-CA- signed certs**, not a CA bundle:

- `TrustedCertStore.__init__` creates the directory unconditionally on the first HTTPS call
  (`os.makedirs(..., mode=0o700)`).
- `trust_permanently()` is the **only writer**, and it only runs when you interactively answer `2`
  ("trust permanently") to a certificate validation prompt — which osc only shows when standard CA
  verification fails (self-signed cert, unknown CA, hostname mismatch, etc.).

`api.opensuse.org` presents a publicly CA-signed cert that the system CA bundle validates on the
first call. No prompt fires, no PEM is written, and `trusted-certs/` correctly stays empty forever.
You'd only see `{host}_{port}.pem` files in there if you pointed `osc` at a self-hosted OBS /
private IBS mirror / staging server with an untrusted cert and chose to trust it permanently.

`trusted-certs/` is **not documented in `oscrc(5)`** because it isn't a configurable path — it's an
internal cache, behaviorally defined by the source. References:
[`osc/oscssl.py`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/blob/master/osc/oscssl.py),
[`osc/util/xdg.py`](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/blob/master/osc/util/xdg.py).

### `HTTP Error 401: authentication required`

The credentials in the oscrc are wrong or expired. Re-run the seeding step (Tier 1 Step 3) to
overwrite the `pass =` line with current credentials.

### `osc whoami` is "not a valid choice"

`osc` has no `whoami` subcommand. Use `osc api /person/<user>` or `osc whois <user>` instead.

### Tokens UI exists but does nothing for general `osc` use

Correct — application tokens only authorize trigger verbs (`rebuild`, `release`, `runservice`,
`workflow`). For everything else, you still need username+password (Tier 1) or SSH-key auth (Tier 4,
where available).

### oscrc is mounted but `osc` still reads `~/.config/osc/oscrc` from the image

Confirm `OSC_CONFIG` is exported in the container's environment, and that the bind mount succeeded:

```bash
env | grep ^OSC_CONFIG
mount | grep -E '(oscrc|osc-container)'
ls -l ~/.config/osc/oscrc
```

### dctl doesn't pick up the new mount

Recreate the container, don't just restart it. Bind mounts are fixed at `docker create` time:

```bash
dctl ws reup  # or your dctl flavor's recreate verb
```

---

## Quick reference — the minimal in-container check

After the setup above, this one line is all the proof you need that auth is wired up correctly:

```bash
osc -A <obs-api-url> api /person/<obs-username> >/dev/null && echo OK
```

Exit 0 → ready to use any `osc` verb. Exit non-zero → walk the troubleshooting list above.
