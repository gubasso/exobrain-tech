# AGENTS

## Scope

Official Claude Code skill specification (pinned from docs) and the dotfiles house style for
authoring skills.

## Key Points

### Official Spec (skill-spec.md)

- Frontmatter fields: `name` (<=64 chars), `description` (recommended, 1536-char cap with
  `when_to_use`), `argument-hint`, `arguments`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`,
  `allowed-tools`, `model`, `effort`, `context`, `agent`, `hooks`, `paths`, `shell`.
- String substitutions: `$ARGUMENTS`, `$ARGUMENTS[N]`, `$name`, `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`,
  `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`.
- Dynamic shell injection: `` !`cmd` `` inline, `` ```! `` block (preprocessing).
- Scope precedence: enterprise > personal > project. Plugin skills namespaced.
- Token budgets: body loaded on trigger (<500 lines), bundled resources on demand, auto-compaction
  keeps first 5000 tokens per skill, 25000 combined cap.

### House Style (skill-style.md)

- Frontmatter minimum: `name`, `description: >` (folded scalar), `argument-hint`.
- Description pattern: what-it-does -> when-to-use -> `Triggers: "phrase 1", "phrase 2"` trailer. Be
  "pushy" on triggers.
- Body: imperative voice, phased (approval gates) or stepped (straight-line), rules section,
  guardrails section.
- No emojis. Fenced code blocks with language tags. Bold for important phrases. NEVER/ALWAYS in caps
  for non-negotiables.
- Preflight `!`-injection for env/git state before Claude reads the body.
- Agent delegation: thin dispatch via Agent tool (not Skill tool for nested delegation).
- Templates: lightweight (~40 lines), mid (~180 lines with approval gate), heavy (~270 lines with
  preflight + retry).
- Staging discipline for `claude/.claude/**`: write to `$RUN_DIR/staging/dotclaude/<rel>`, install
  atomically at end.

### Script Extraction (skill-script-extraction.md)

- Skill bodies load in full on every invocation, so inline deterministic shell costs load-time
  tokens every time. Move it into versioned `agent-helper` subcommands: saves tokens, runs
  byte-identically, is bats-testable.
- Rule: extract any deterministic shell chunk that is more than a trivial one-liner (single-use is
  fine). Guardrails: split judgment-tangled chunks, keep trivial one-liners inline, coarse-not-micro
  (one subcommand → one JSON object), prompt/message content stays model-authored.
- Skill-as-orchestrator: parse args, call subcommands, read a few JSON fields, apply judgment
  between calls. RUN_DIR is the durable handoff (shell state does not persist between Bash calls);
  re-source `$RUN_DIR/paths.env`.
- Output/status contract via `agent-helper msg`: machine lines to STDOUT (`RESOLVED <path>`,
  `<CTX>_OK`, `<CTX>_FAILED`, `KEY=value`), human messages to STDERR (stage/info/ warn/error/fatal).
  Parents parse the last status line; nothing may follow it.
- Degradation: bare `agent-helper` call (no stale `_tmp` fallback); `agent-helper require <cmd>...`
  capability gate; `agent-helper --version`; soft deps warn, hard deps fail closed.
- Testing: every subcommand gets a bats suite; highest-risk gets adversarial fixtures.

## Maintenance Notes

- `skill-spec.md` is pinned from `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`; re-fetch on major Claude
  Code releases.
- House style evolves with the dotfiles skill collection.
