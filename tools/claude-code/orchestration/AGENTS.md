# AGENTS

## Scope

Reusable orchestration patterns for multi-stage Claude Code + Codex workflows: sandbox detection,
proof-of-delegation, lock files, review-loop handoff, and verdict/severity model.

## Key Points

### Sandbox Detection

- Run once per workflow, not per stage. Persist `SANDBOX_MODE` by literal substitution.
- Fallback: `-c 'sandbox_permissions=...'` for read-only;
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for write.

### Proof-of-Delegation

- Pre-snapshot -> delegate via Agent tool -> post-snapshot + diff -> validate output file and proof
  diff exist.
- Fail closed on missing evidence. Never retry automatically; never fall back to inline work.

### Lock File Management

- Location: `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/`. Two-line content: `$RUN_DIR` path and owning `$PPID`.
- Atomic creation via write-to-tmp + `mv`. Release before user-facing pauses; reacquire after.

### Verdict and Severity Model

- Verdicts: `APPROVED`, `APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS`, `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, `REJECTED`.
- Severities: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFO`.
- Categories: correctness, security, performance, reliability, maintainability, compatibility.

## Maintenance Notes

- Patterns here are contracts used by multiple skills (prex, review-loop).
