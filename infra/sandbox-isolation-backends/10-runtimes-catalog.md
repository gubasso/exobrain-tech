# Sandbox & isolation runtime catalog

> Status: Reference Scope: Per-option evaluation of every sandbox/runtime/VMM considered as an
> isolation backend for running untrusted or AI-agent code from OCI images. Reading order: the
> [threat model and principles](./00-threat-model-and-principles.md) first (premises and threat
> model), then this catalog.

This document catalogs every sandbox option evaluated as an isolation backend for untrusted /
AI-agent workloads, the verdict for each, and the reasoning behind it. The final default backend is
**not chosen in this catalog** — see the candidate set and the criteria for selection in the
[libkrun Linux decision](./20-decision-libkrun-linux.md).

## 0. How to read this document

Each entry uses the same shape:

- **What it is** — engine, layer (runtime / VMM / shim), upstream.
- **Security posture** — boundary type (`shared kernel` | `userspace kernel` | `hypervisor`) and CVE
  evidence relevant to the AI-agent threat model.
- **OCI / devcontainer fit** — does it consume existing OCI images and `devcontainer.json`
  semantics?
- **Maintenance** — release cadence, project health, corporate backers.
- **What the integrating tool owns** — concrete plumbing the integrating tool would have to write
  and maintain.
- **Verdict** — one of:
  - `viable default candidate` — meets the security premise; in scope for the hardware-isolation
    selection.
  - `viable fallback` — meets a degraded scenario (e.g. no-KVM CI runner).
  - `viable controller` — useful as the front-end around a stronger boundary.
  - `defense-in-depth only` — must be applied **inside** a stronger boundary; cannot replace it.
  - `rejected (laptop)` / `rejected (out of scope)` / `rejected (archived)` / `rejected (TCB)` /
    `rejected (wrong threat model)` — kept here so the rejection reasoning is auditable.
  - `inspirational only` — informs design; not a backend.

Rejection reasoning is required so future revisions can audit whether the constraints have changed.

---

## 1. Rejected — shared-kernel containers as the primary boundary

These options are documented to make the rejection reasoning explicit (see the
[threat model and principles](./00-threat-model-and-principles.md)). They are **not** acceptable as
the primary sandbox for the AI-agent threat model.

### 1.1 Bare Podman (rootful)

- **What it is** — Daemonless rootful OCI runtime; shared-kernel boundary semantics.
- **Security posture** — Shared kernel. Container escape via runc mount-race / procfs symlink tricks
  lands as **host root**. Every kernel LPE (bpf, io_uring, netfilter) is a host compromise.
- **CVE evidence (recent)** — runc CVE-2025-31133, CVE-2025-52565, CVE-2025-52881 (Nov 2025) all
  deliver full container breakout via mount races and procfs symlink tricks; affect rootful Podman
  directly. [Sysdig analysis](https://www.sysdig.com/blog/runc-container-escape-vulnerabilities);
  [CNCF technical overview](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/11/28/runc-container-breakout-vulnerabilities-a-technical-overview/).
- **OCI fit** — native baseline.
- **Maintenance** — excellent, but irrelevant: the boundary is structurally insufficient for the
  threat model.
- **Verdict — `rejected`.** Namespaces are a resource-control mechanism, not a security boundary;
  the 1:1 UID mapping makes escape outcomes worst-case (host root).

### 1.2 Hardened-container path (seccomp / AppArmor / cap-drop only)

- **What it is** — Strong seccomp profile, AppArmor profile, `cap-drop=ALL`, `no-new-privileges`.
  The hygiene hardening enumerated in the
  [threat model & principles](./00-threat-model-and-principles.md) (§2).
- **Security posture** — Defense-in-depth: each layer raises the cost of an exploit but cannot
  prevent kernel-level LPEs from succeeding.
- **Verdict — `defense-in-depth only`.** Required **inside** the chosen primary boundary, not as a
  substitute for it.

---

## 2. Reduced-blast-radius containers (better, still insufficient as primary)

### 2.1 Podman rootless

- **What it is** — Daemonless rootless OCI runtime; fork-exec per invocation, no persistent
  privileged process. Container UIDs remapped via `/etc/subuid`.
  [Podman rootless tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md);
  [Red Hat: rootless Podman user-namespace modes](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rootless-podman-user-namespace-modes).
- **Security posture** — Best-of-class shared-kernel posture: no daemon, userns by default,
  slirp4netns/pasta networking. Escape lands as **invoking user**, not host root. **Still shared
  kernel** — Nov 2025 runc CVEs apply.
- **OCI fit** — full; consumes existing OCI images via `podman run`.
- **Maintenance** — active under `containers/` org.
- **Verdict — `defense-in-depth only`** when used as the boundary; **`viable controller`** when
  paired with a microVM runtime (libkrun via `crun --krun` in §4.4 is the canonical example: Podman
  is the front-end, the microVM is the boundary).

### 2.2 bubblewrap / Landlock / seccomp-only

- **What it is** — `bwrap` is already used **inside** agent containers (e.g. by Codex CLI) as an
  inner sandbox. As an outer sandbox: namespaces + seccomp + Landlock LSM.
- **Security posture** — shared kernel; Landlock policy language is still maturing.
- **Verdict — `defense-in-depth only`.** Useful as inner layer, not the primary boundary.

---

## 3. Userspace-kernel sandbox

### 3.1 gVisor (`runsc`)

- **What it is** — Google's userspace kernel. OCI-compliant runtime under containerd. Re-implements
  ~200 Linux syscalls in memory-safe Go and forwards a tiny subset to the host kernel.
  [gvisor.dev/docs](https://gvisor.dev/docs/),
  [performance guide](https://gvisor.dev/docs/architecture_guide/performance/).
- **Security posture** — A _different_ boundary: not hardware, not shared-kernel. The host kernel
  only sees what `runsc` chose to forward, eliminating the kernel-LPE class for unforwarded
  syscalls. Bugs in `runsc`'s own implementation are still host-side compromises. Used in production
  by Modal and Cloud Run for untrusted code.
- **Trade-offs** — 10–30% syscall overhead on I/O-heavy workloads; **incomplete syscall coverage**
  breaks some perf tooling, FUSE, namespacing tricks, exotic ptrace usage.
- **OCI fit** — full; drop-in OCI runtime under containerd.
- **Maintenance** — active, Google-backed.
- **Verdict — `viable fallback`.** The right answer for **no-KVM environments** (CI runners, cloud
  VMs without nested virt). Not the primary default because hardware isolation is qualitatively
  stronger for the AI-agent threat model and gVisor's syscall coverage gaps surface as devcontainer
  breakage.

---

## 4. Hardware-virtualization microVMs — the primary candidate set

These options meet the core premise: a hypervisor-class boundary between agent-executed code and the
host kernel (see the [threat model and principles](./00-threat-model-and-principles.md)). **No final
default has been chosen** among them; the [libkrun Linux decision](./20-decision-libkrun-linux.md)
lists the selection criteria.

### 4.1 Bare Firecracker (integrating-tool-owned controller)

- **What it is** — Direct use of the Firecracker VMM with a thin integrating-tool-owned controller.
  Firecracker exposes an HTTP API for boot configuration (kernel, rootfs, vCPU, memory, network).
  The `jailer` process chroots, applies seccomp, drops privileges, then `exec`s Firecracker —
  minimizing the host-side attack surface.
  [Firecracker design doc](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/design.md);
  [AWS open-source announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/firecracker-open-source-secure-fast-microvm-serverless/).
- **Security posture** — KVM microVM with a deliberately tiny device model: virtio-net, virtio-blk,
  serial, partial keyboard controller, KVM-provided interrupt controllers. ~50–83K LoC of Rust.
  Threat model: every vCPU thread is treated as if it were running malicious code from the moment it
  starts. **Zero published hypervisor-escape CVEs in 2024–2026**; one jailer host-side LPE.
  Hypervisor escapes carry $250K–$500K bounty-class economics
  ([emirb microvm-2026](https://emirb.github.io/blog/microvm-2026/),
  [stack.watch FC CVEs](https://stack.watch/product/amazon/firecracker/)).
  [Microarchitectural security analysis (arXiv 2311.15999)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15999).
- **Performance** — Boots in ~125 ms with <5 MiB overhead per VM; sustains ~150 VMs/s/host
  (Firecracker NSDI'20).
- **OCI fit** — none directly. Firecracker consumes a kernel image + ext4 rootfs; OCI images must be
  converted by the controller.
- **Maintenance** — active, AWS-maintained (Lambda + Fargate substrate).
  [Repository](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker).
- **What the integrating tool owns:**
  - rootfs builder (skopeo + umoci + mkfs.ext4 + cp -a; ~20 lines bash)
  - TAP device + NAT/route plumbing (~10 lines `ip`)
  - in-guest init (mount /proc, eth0, vsock listener, exec agent)
  - controller via [firecracker-go-sdk](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-go-sdk)
    or [firepilot](https://github.com/rik-org/firepilot) (~500 LOC helper binary)
  - vsock-based exec channel (`socat` or small helper)
  - own lifecycle interpreter for `devcontainer.json` (already needed by the container-first plan;
    not FC-specific)
  - kernel image lifecycle (updates, signing)
- **Cost estimate** — ~3–5 calendar weeks one-time + ongoing maintenance of rootfs builder, kernel
  updates, in-guest agent.
- **Public precedent** — firebuild, [buildfs (crates.io)](https://crates.io/crates/buildfs),
  [iximiuz Firecracker hands-on](https://labs.iximiuz.com/courses/firecracker-hands-on/run-first-microvm),
  [single-app rootfs cookbook](https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/fc-rootfs/),
  [firectl](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl), archived
  [Ignite](https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite) reference recipes.
- **Verdict — `viable default candidate`** (high-assurance / power-user path). Smallest TCB of any
  option, lowest supply-chain risk, highest implementation cost. Worth keeping as a documented
  escape hatch even if not the default.

### 4.2 Firecracker via Kata Containers

- **What it is** — Kata Containers (OCI-compliant runtime, containerd shim, kata-agent inside the
  guest) using Firecracker as the underlying VMM. [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/);
  [Kata + Firecracker how-to](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/how-to-use-kata-containers-with-firecracker.md);
  [Kata releases](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases).
- **Security posture** — Same Firecracker boundary as §4.1, plus Kata's containerd shim and the
  kata-agent inside the guest. Hypervisor boundary; small TCB on the VMM side, larger TCB on the
  runtime side.
- **OCI fit** — full; `nerdctl --runtime io.containerd.kata.v2`.
- **Maintenance — Kata project** — CNCF incubating
  ([October 2025 PTG update](https://katacontainers.io/blog/kata-community-ptg-updates-october-2025/)).
  ~3-week release cadence (3.23.0 → 3.30.0 in 6 months as of May 2026). ~1,515 open / ~4,451 closed
  issues; lifetime closure rate ~75%; net-deflating in trailing 12 months (closes 1.6× the open
  rate). Cross-vendor maintainers (Intel, Red Hat, Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba). Production users
  include Baidu, Alibaba, AWS, Northflank.
- **Maintenance — Kata-on-FC specifically** — second-class within Kata. Firecracker has **no
  virtio-fs**, so Kata-on-FC requires the **devmapper snapshotter** with a block device per
  container, losing the bind-mount UX virtio-fs gives Kata-on-QEMU/CH. 66 open Kata issues mention
  Firecracker; e.g. [#12558](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/issues/12558),
  [#8843](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/issues/8843),
  [#13008](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/issues/13008).
- **What the integrating tool owns** — runtime-class registration in containerd, devmapper setup,
  host KVM detection. Kernel image, rootfs builder, in-guest agent are upstream.
- **Verdict — `viable default candidate`.** Strong security; substantial operational friction from
  the devmapper + containerd + Kata stack on a developer laptop.

### 4.3 Cloud Hypervisor via Kata Containers

- **What it is** — Kata with
  [Cloud Hypervisor](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor) as the VMM. CH is a Rust
  user-space VMM over KVM, sibling to Firecracker, sharing rust-vmm crates.
- **Security posture vs FC** — Same KVM boundary class. Larger device surface in default config:
  ~106K LoC vs FC's ~50–83K; supports virtio-fs, virtio-mem, virtio-vsock, PCI hotplug, VFIO,
  vhost-user, GPU passthrough, nested KVM. Trimmable via build/feature flags. Adds Landlock-based
  host-side sandboxing
  ([CH landlock.md](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/docs/landlock.md)).
  Zero published hypervisor-escape CVEs 2024–2026
  ([CH release notes](https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/release-notes.md)).
- **Net assessment** — Equivalent to FC in **kind** (KVM, user-space VMM, rust-vmm primitives).
  Slightly worse in default device **surface**; Landlock partly compensates. Not a security upgrade
  over FC; not a security regression over FC. The choice between them collapses to operational fit,
  not threat-model strength.
- **OCI fit** — full via Kata.
- **Maintenance** — very active (v50/v51 in Feb 2026); ~5,612 stars; Intel/Microsoft-led.
- **Practical edge over Kata-on-FC** — virtio-fs (no devmapper snapshotter required), nested KVM
  (DinD works), GPU passthrough. The path the Kata community actually exercises in production
  ([Northflank: Kata vs Firecracker vs gVisor](https://northflank.com/blog/kata-containers-vs-firecracker-vs-gvisor);
  [AWS: enhancing Kubernetes workload isolation with Kata](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/enhancing-kubernetes-workload-isolation-and-security-using-kata-containers/)).
- **Verdict — `viable default candidate`.** Kept on the table (FC-like options are explicitly in
  scope). Operationally smoother than Kata-on-FC; identical security class.

### 4.4 libkrun via `crun --krun` (Podman-rootless front-end)

- **What it is** — Rust VMM under [libkrun/libkrun](https://github.com/libkrun/libkrun) (v1.18.0,
  2026-04-24). Code partly **derived from Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, and rust-vmm**. Integrates
  with `crun` via `crun --krun`, which is a Podman-native OCI runtime.
  [Red Hat: RamaLama + libkrun (Jul 2025)](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/07/02/supercharging-ai-isolation-microvms-ramalama-libkrun);
  [libkrun/krunvm](https://github.com/libkrun/krunvm).
- **Security posture** — KVM microVM; same hardware-isolation class as FC. Maintainer's threat model
  ([libkrun #538](https://github.com/libkrun/libkrun/discussions/538)): "the guest and the VMM
  pertain to the same security context… should be thought of as a single entity." `crun --krun`
  wraps the microVM in Podman-rootless's userns + seccomp envelope, providing the host-side
  containment FC's `jailer` provides standalone.
- **Residual host-facing device set vs. bare Firecracker** — same boundary class, **wider**
  host-side surface in three places: **virtio-fs is the default rootfs path** (how `crun --krun`
  mounts the OCI bundle into the guest; Firecracker has no virtio-fs and pays a
  devmapper-snapshotter cost in Kata-on-FC); **TSI's host-side proxy** terminates per-connection TCP
  on the host's `AF_INET` stack via real userspace sockets
  ([libkrunfw TSI patch](https://github.com/libkrun/libkrunfw/tree/main/patches)) — different from
  FC's TAP+netfilter path, not strictly smaller; **virtio-gpu (virgl/venus)** is available via
  `krun_set_gpu_options` (FC has no GPU support) but is **off by default** in
  `podman --runtime krun`. These are the technical content behind the §4.4 trade-off, not a
  boundary-class regression — a guest-kernel LPE remains a guest-kernel compromise, not a host
  compromise. See the [libkrun vs Firecracker comparison](./30-libkrun-vs-firecracker.md) for the
  cross-candidate framing of residual host-kernel surface.
- **OCI fit** — full. `podman --runtime krun run <image>` consumes OCI images directly; rootfs
  conversion is internal to `crun-krun`. No bespoke builder.
- **Networking** — TSI (Transparent Socket Impersonation) removes TAP/bridge/NAT plumbing on the
  host in exchange for a host-side userspace proxy.
- **Maintenance** — active under `containers/` org (same org as Podman, crun, Buildah). Powers
  Microsandbox, RamaLama, krunvm.
- **Cross-platform** — Linux KVM and macOS HVF (Hypervisor.framework) backends.
- **What the integrating tool owns** — a thin per-runtime adapter that adds `--runtime krun` to
  existing Podman calls. Rootfs conversion, kernel image, in-guest agent are all upstream.
- **Verdict — `viable default candidate`** (lowest plumbing cost). Equivalent security boundary to
  FC with the smallest implementation footprint among hardware-virt options. Trade-off: more
  upstream code on the trust path than bare-FC.

### 4.5 QEMU `microvm` machine type

- **What it is** — QEMU's stripped-down machine type optimized for microVM workloads. Same KVM
  boundary as §4.1–§4.4.
- **Security posture** — Same KVM boundary class, but TCB is ~1.4M LoC of C with a multi-decade
  device-emulation CVE history
  ([Northflank: Firecracker vs QEMU](https://northflank.com/blog/firecracker-vs-qemu)).
- **Verdict — `rejected (TCB)`** as the laptop default. Same boundary class, much larger TCB. No
  security gain and a real loss vs FC/CH/libkrun. Useful only when a user explicitly needs a feature
  only QEMU provides (e.g. exotic device passthrough).

### 4.6 Apple `container` (macOS)

- **What it is** — Swift, open-source, [`apple/container`](https://github.com/apple/container)
  (macOS 26+). One lightweight VM per Linux container via Virtualization.framework. Sub-second cold
  start. [InfoQ coverage](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/06/apple-container-linux/);
  [The Register: Apple Containerization](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/10/apple_tries_to_contain_itself/).
- **Security posture** — Hypervisor boundary via Apple's Virtualization.framework /
  Hypervisor.framework. Not Firecracker, but the same architectural class on Apple silicon.
  Effectively "FC-for-Mac."
- **OCI fit** — full; `container run`-style CLI.
- **Maintenance** — Apple-backed; macOS 26+ only.
- **Verdict — `viable default candidate (macOS)`.** Pairs with libkrun/Kata as the Linux-side
  equivalent. **Open question:** does libkrun's macOS HVF backend reach feature parity, or does
  Apple `container` remain the Mac-native path?

---

## 5. Specialized / wrong-shaped at this layer

### 5.1 firecracker-containerd

- **What it is** — containerd shim + snapshotter for Firecracker. AWS-maintained; no GitHub releases
  ever cut; commits active.
  [firecracker-containerd snapshotter docs](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd/blob/main/docs/snapshotter.md).
- **Verdict — `rejected (laptop)`.** Cluster/operator-shaped, no per-developer ergonomics story.
  Useful component, wrong layer for a developer-laptop tool.

### 5.2 flintlock

- **What it is** — Cluster-scale microVM lifecycle manager. v0.9.1 released 2025-11-19 under
  `liquidmetal-dev` (post-Weaveworks). [Repository](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock).
- **Verdict — `rejected (laptop)`.** Cluster-shaped. Not a per-developer tool.

### 5.3 Ignite (Weaveworks)

- **What it is** — Weaveworks' Firecracker-as-container-CLI tool. Archived in 2023.
  [Repository (archived)](https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite).
- **Verdict — `rejected (archived)`.** Reference recipes still useful for the bare-FC path (§4.1).

### 5.4 SUSE flake-pilot / firecracker-pilot

- **What it is** — [OSInside/flake-pilot](https://github.com/OSInside/flake-pilot). App launcher:
  symlink → launcher → podman or Firecracker backend.
  [SUSE Package Hub](https://packagehub.suse.com/packages/flake-pilot/).
- **Why considered** — Deployments that ship an openSUSE-based image make SUSE-aligned tooling a
  natural fit candidate.
- **Why it doesn't fit** — The Firecracker backend uses **kernel + rootfs tarballs from HTTPS**, not
  OCI registries. It bypasses the entire Containerfile / devcontainer build flow that an
  OCI-image-based tool is built around. Tiny project (~8 stars), DIY networking (manual TAP, kernel
  msgs leak into stdout). The OCI image flow would have to be re-implemented anyway.
- **Verdict — `inspirational only`.** A useful example of a thin SUSE-native FC wrapper; not a
  backend to adopt.

### 5.5 Hyperlight (Microsoft)

- **What it is** — CNCF Sandbox 2025; embeddable Rust VMM with **no kernel, no OS in the guest**.
  ~1ms startup.
  [Microsoft introduction (Nov 2024)](https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/07/introducing-hyperlight-virtual-machine-based-security-for-functions-at-scale/).
- **Verdict — `rejected (out of scope)`.** Designed for WebAssembly modules and individual function
  calls. Cannot host `python`, `cargo`, `git`, or a developer's full toolchain. Wrong shape for
  AI-agent workloads.

### 5.6 Confidential Containers / Kata-CoCo (TDX / SEV-SNP)

- **What it is** — Kata variant designed against a _malicious host_ (untrusted cloud operator).
  Hardware-attested isolation.
- **Verdict — `rejected (wrong threat model)`.** The AI-agent threat model trusts the host (the
  developer's laptop) and distrusts the workload (see the
  [threat model and principles](./00-threat-model-and-principles.md)). CoCo solves the inverse
  problem (trusted workload, untrusted host).

### 5.7 V8 isolates / WebAssembly sandboxes

- **What it is** — Process-internal language sandboxes.
- **Verdict — `rejected (out of scope)`.** Cannot run `pytest`, `cargo build`, native dependency
  builds, or the agent's full toolchain.

### 5.8 youki + Firecracker hooks

- **What it is** — youki is a Rust OCI runtime
  ([youki-dev/youki](https://github.com/youki-dev/youki), 7.4k stars).
- **Verdict — `rejected (no FC integration today)`.** youki itself is healthy, but does not ship a
  Firecracker integration. Not a Firecracker-composing path in 2026.

### 5.9 AWS firecracker-task-driver / Nomad

- **What it is** — Nomad's Firecracker driver for cluster scheduling.
- **Verdict — `rejected (cluster only)`.** Wrong shape for a developer-laptop CLI.
