# libkrun vs bare Firecracker (via flake-pilot)

A technical tradeoff analysis between two KVM microVM sandbox stacks: **libkrun** driven by
`crun --krun` behind rootless Podman, versus **bare Firecracker** driven by
[OSInside/flake-pilot](https://github.com/OSInside/flake-pilot)'s `firecracker-pilot` backend over
bare [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) microVMs.

The core finding up front: both approaches sit in the **same KVM hardware-virtualization isolation
class**. Neither shares the host kernel with the guest — so the real question is _which_ microVM
stack, not _whether_ to use one. For related material see

| **flake-pilot (`firecracker-pilot`) + Firecracker** | **KVM microVM** | KIWI KIS tarballs over HTTPS + flake YAML | Manual TAP + iptables + NAT | `sudo` per invocation | Firecracker is mature (powers AWS Lambda / Fargate). flake-pilot is a registration/provisioning framework with multiple backend pilots (`podman-pilot`, `firecracker-pilot`); this comparison evaluates the `firecracker-pilot` path. |

**Both approaches sit in the same KVM hardware-virtualization isolation class.** Neither shares the
host kernel with the guest; both rely on KVM as the security boundary. The framing that "VMs are the
only safe option to shield host data" applies equally to either — collapsing the question to _which_
microVM stack, not _whether_ to use one.

Throughout this document, **libkrun** refers to libkrun via `crun --krun` fronted by
Podman-rootless. Against the goals of strong isolation, low owned-plumbing, OCI-native authoring,
rootless invocation, simple networking, and production-proven upstreams, flake-pilot + Firecracker
does not present an advantage on the boundary axis; it loses on engineering cost, networking
simplicity, privilege model, authoring surface, and image distribution model.

## 1. The two approaches

### 1.1 libkrun via `crun --krun` + Podman-rootless

Architecture in one paragraph: [`libkrun/libkrun`](https://github.com/libkrun/libkrun) is a Rust
user-space VMM (rust-vmm lineage, partly derived from Firecracker and Cloud Hypervisor). Passing
`--krun` to [`crun`](https://github.com/containers/crun) boots the OCI bundle inside a libkrun
microVM instead of a namespaces-only container; Podman drives it as a normal OCI runtime:
`podman --runtime krun run <image>`. Networking is **TSI (Transparent Socket Impersonation)** —
in-guest sockets are transparently forwarded to host sockets through libkrun, with no TAP device,
bridge, NAT, or `slirp4netns` plumbing on the host side.

Invocation surface for the user: the integrating tool sets `--runtime krun` on the existing rootless
Podman invocation. No additional config required; existing OCI artifacts are consumed unchanged.

### 1.2 flake-pilot + Firecracker

[`OSInside/flake-pilot`](https://github.com/OSInside/flake-pilot) is a registration/provisioning
framework for running applications inside isolated environments. It ships multiple backend "pilots";
per the upstream README, _"as of today, support for the `podman` and `firecracker` engines is
implemented, leading to the respective `podman-pilot` and `firecracker-pilot` launcher binaries."_
The framework's primary contribution is enabling semi-transparent container/VM instances that can
run provisioning steps before execution. **This comparison evaluates the `firecracker-pilot` backend
specifically** — that is the path the alternative approach exercises. Images for the Firecracker
path are [KIWI](https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/)-built **KIS** artifacts (kernel + initrd + rootfs
tarball) distributed over HTTPS, not OCI registries. Packaging is primarily through openSUSE
repositories; the source is Rust and can be built on other distributions from source.

Reference invocation (as documented upstream):

```text
sudo flake-ctl firecracker pull \
    --name <name> \
    --kis-image <https-url>/<image>.x86_64-<version>.tar.xz

sudo flake-ctl firecracker register \
    --vm <name> \
    --app /usr/bin/<launcher-name> \
    --target /bin/bash \
    --overlay-size 20GiB \
    --force-vsock \
    --resume

sudo <launcher-name>
```

Networking is **deferred to manual TAP + iptables + NAT setup** by the host operator, per the
upstream README's [networking section](https://github.com/OSInside/flake-pilot#networking-): _"it is
the user's responsibility to set up the routing on the host from the TUN/TAP device to the outside
world."_

**Honest assessment of the "VMs are the only safe option to shield host data" framing.** The claim
is technically correct **as a comparison against shared-kernel containers** — KVM-class isolation is
qualitatively stronger than namespaces + seccomp + AppArmor + userns, and the Nov 2025 runc CVE
cluster is the canonical recent precedent. libkrun and the flake-pilot approach **both** satisfy the
hardware-virtualization premise (see
[00-threat-model-and-principles.md](./00-threat-model-and-principles.md)). The claim therefore
collapses to a choice **between two KVM stacks**, not between "VM" and "container." Interpreted as
"Firecracker specifically is the only safe option," the framing is overstated: libkrun delivers the
same boundary class with a far smaller owned plumbing surface and the same KVM-level guest kernel
isolation.

| Disk footprint               | libkrun reuses Podman's image store directly via OCI layers. Layers are shared across containers built from the same base image.                                                                                       | Each registered VM gets its own overlay (20 GiB in the upstream demo). **No layer sharing** across registrations. KIS artifacts are full kernel + initrd + rootfs tarballs distributed via HTTPS, not OCI registries. |
| Image distribution model     | **OCI registries** — same as the rest of the ecosystem. Reuses the existing OCI push/pull tooling and any registry already operated. Compatible with cosign / sigstore / digest pinning.                               | **HTTPS file servers** distributing KIS tarballs.

| Iteration loop cost          | Sub-second on a warm system; the adapter is a thin per-runtime shim.                                                                                                                                                   | Acceptable for one long-lived warm VM via `--resume`; expensive for many short-lived experiments because every VM is a full kernel boot + rootfs overlay and there is no container-grade image-layer cache.           |
| Density                      | Bounded by the same KVM/memory limits as any microVM stack.                                                                                                                                                            | Same KVM/memory limits; lower disk density because no layer sharing.                                                                                                                                                  |

Bare-Firecracker plumbing is a multi-week one-time build plus a permanent maintenance tail; flake-pilot's `firecracker-pilot` covers some of that orchestration but does not eliminate the rootfs/distribution/networking pieces. |

Note on the authoring/IDE relationship: the OCI / `devcontainer.json` authoring surface is preserved
by the libkrun stack because it reuses the existing image pipeline. Editor or IDE integration is
**not a goal here**; the OCI compatibility matters for the **build and distribution** model, not for
IDE support.

## 6. Fit to the stated goals

Scoring against neutral goals — strong isolation, low owned-plumbing, OCI-native authoring, rootless
invocation, simple networking, and production-proven upstream. The scorecard:

| Criterion                                        | libkrun                                                                                                 | flake-pilot + Firecracker                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Security via KVM-class hardware-virt boundary | **Met.** KVM microVM.                                                                                   | **Met.** KVM microVM. **No delta.**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2. Production-proven, well-maintained            | **Met.** `containers/` org; RamaLama / Microsandbox / krunvm in production.                             | **Partial.** Firecracker is production-proven; the `firecracker-pilot` binary that sits in the trust path on the Firecracker path does not have comparable public production-deployment evidence.                        |
| 3. Clean UX, minimal owned plumbing              | **Met.** Thin per-runtime adapter; OCI-native; rootless; TSI removes host networking plumbing entirely. | **Not met.** Manual TAP + iptables, `sudo` per call, no OCI compatibility, operator-owned image distribution via HTTPS.                                                                                                  |
| 4. Single working Linux implementation           | **Met.** One adapter, one manifest value.                                                               | **Partial.** Single Linux implementation in principle, but feature parity with the libkrun stack requires re-implementing the OCI build/distribution pipeline against KIS images, plus owning the host networking story. |
| 5. Migration cheap                               | **Met.** Adapter is small; behind the runtime interface a future swap is mechanical.                    | **Partial.** Adopting flake-pilot now means moving the authoring surface off OCI; that is a deep migration and the inverse direction from the libkrun stack.                                                             |

[10-runtimes-catalog.md](./10-runtimes-catalog.md) catalogs flake-pilot and notes the same
architectural drivers visible here: the OCI-incompatible image flow on the Firecracker path, the
operator-owned host networking, and a `firecracker-pilot` launcher binary that would land in the
integrating tool's trust path.

---

## 7. Verdict

### 7.1 Where libkrun wins

- **Engineering cost.** A thin per-runtime adapter vs. the rootfs/kernel/init/vsock/TAP plumbing
  project the flake-pilot path would require the integrating tool to own to reach feature parity.
- **Host-side networking attack surface.** TSI removes host TAP/bridge/NAT; flake-pilot requires the
  operator to construct and maintain that chain.
  ([flake-pilot README — networking](https://github.com/OSInside/flake-pilot#networking-))
- **Privilege model.** Rootless invocation vs. `sudo` per invocation.
- **Image authoring and distribution.** OCI registries with the existing build pipeline vs. KIS
  tarballs over HTTPS distributed by operator-run file servers; signing and digest pinning come for
  free with OCI.
- **Egress policy enforcement.** A runtime-agnostic egress allowlist shipped by the integrating tool
  vs. operator-owned manual filtering.
- **Production-proven upstream.** `containers/` org with RamaLama / Microsandbox / krunvm in
  production. Firecracker itself is production-proven at AWS scale, but the `firecracker-pilot`
  launcher binary that would sit in the trust path does not have comparable public
  production-deployment evidence.
- **Maintenance posture.** Distro-packaged CVE pipeline across the major Linux distributions vs.
  SUSE-aligned packaging and a thin wrapper to track.

### 7.2 Scenarios excluded from this comparison

Two scenarios sometimes cited as advantageous for flake-pilot + Firecracker are **out of scope** for
this comparison because they do not correspond to the stated goals:

- **"Smallest possible host-side VMM TCB"** is not a selection criterion here. The security premise
  is the **boundary class** (KVM hardware-virtualization), which is satisfied identically by libkrun
  and bare Firecracker. A smaller VMM TCB tightens the host trust path but does not raise the
  isolation class. If a future deployment ever requires the smallest possible VMM TCB on the host,
  the bare-Firecracker adapter slot remains documented in
  [10-runtimes-catalog.md](./10-runtimes-catalog.md) for opt-in — but it is catalog-only.
- **"Distribution-specific (e.g. openSUSE-only) deployments"** is not a selection criterion here.
  The target is KVM-capable Linux broadly; distribution coverage is met by libkrun's
  `containers/`-org packaging across Fedora, openSUSE, Arch, Debian, and Ubuntu. A
  distribution-aligned packaging story is a distribution preference, not a security or correctness
  property that would tilt the decision.

### 7.3 Where flake-pilot + Firecracker does not present a relevant win

Outside of the two excluded scenarios in §7.2, **there is no axis relevant to the stated goals on
which flake-pilot + Firecracker presents a genuine advantage over libkrun.** It has the same
boundary class, a more demanding host-networking model, a `sudo`-on-every-call privilege model, and
an image distribution model that abandons OCI without compensating benefits for the stated use case.

### 7.4 Bottom line

libkrun and the flake-pilot `firecracker-pilot` + Firecracker path share the same isolation class
(KVM microVM). libkrun wins on engineering cost, host-networking simplicity (TSI vs. manual
TAP/NAT), rootless vs. sudo, OCI vs. KIS-over-HTTPS, its shipped egress allowlist, production proof,
and maintenance posture. flake-pilot's Firecracker backend is a valid microVM-based sandboxing
approach with its own architectural choices — but adopting it as the runtime backend would require
the integrating tool to take on a substantial owned plumbing surface (KIS image distribution, manual
host networking, the `firecracker-pilot` trust path) in exchange for no security gain over libkrun.
