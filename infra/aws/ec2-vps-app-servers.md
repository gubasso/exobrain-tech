# AWS: EC2 VPS App Servers

## Practical

ssh to an ec2 instance

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<my-private-aws-key>.pem ec2-user@<public-ip-address>
```

## Cli

### Command examples

Get images information with filters

```sh
aws ec2 describe-images \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=*suse*" "Name=name,Values=*sles*" "Name=name,Values=*-sap-*" "Name=name,Values=*byos*" \
  --query "Images[*].Name"

aws ec2 describe-images \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=suse-sles-sap-15-sp6-byos-v20241113-hvm-ssd-x86_64*" \
  --query "Images[*].Name"
```

## General

App Servers: Application servers are the compute instances that run your application code They
process requests, execute business logic, and generate responses to be sent back to the client In a
typical web application, app servers handle the core functionality and interact with databases and
other backend services Examples include Apache Tomcat for Java applications, Microsoft IIS for .NET,
or Node.js for JavaScript

You are correct in your understanding of app servers and EC2 instances. To summarize:

- An app server is a software framework or platform that hosts and runs web applications. It handles
  the application logic, data processing, and other core functionalities.

- In AWS, an EC2 instance serves as a virtual private server (VPS) that can be used to set up an app
  server environment.

- An EC2 instance is essentially a virtual machine running a full operating system, typically a
  Linux distribution like Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.

- On this EC2 instance, you can install and configure any runtime environment needed for your
  application, such as:

  - Node.js to run an Express server for a JavaScript application
  - Python and a WSGI server like Gunicorn to run a Flask or Django application
  - Java and a servlet container like Tomcat for Java-based apps
  - PHP with Apache or Nginx for WordPress and other PHP apps

- Along with the core runtime, you would also set up any necessary dependencies, databases, caching
  layers, etc. on the EC2 instance to create a complete application server environment.

So in essence, the EC2 instance provides the underlying computing resources (CPU, memory, storage),
while the software you install on it (Node.js, Python, databases, etc.) forms the actual application
server stack that powers your web application.

The flexibility to customize the software stack on an EC2 instance allows you to create app server
environments tailored to your specific application's needs, all on top of the scalable,
pay-as-you-go infrastructure provided by AWS.
