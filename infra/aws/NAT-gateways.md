# AWS NAT Gateways

NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway is an AWS managed service that allows instances in private
subnets to initiate outbound connections to the internet or other AWS services, while preventing the
internet from initiating inbound connections to those instances.

Here are the key points about NAT gateways:

1. Enable outbound internet access: NAT gateways allow instances in private subnets to connect to
   the internet for tasks like downloading software updates, accessing external APIs, or fetching
   data.

2. Prevent inbound connections: At the same time, NAT gateways do not allow inbound connections
   initiated from the internet, thus providing a layer of security for instances in private subnets.

3. Managed service: NAT Gateway is a fully managed service by AWS. It is automatically scaled up or
   down based on the amount of traffic and is highly available within an Availability Zone.

4. Placement: NAT gateways are created in a specific public subnet and associated with an Elastic IP
   address. Instances in private subnets route their internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway.

5. Redundancy: For high availability, it's recommended to create NAT gateways in multiple
   Availability Zones and configure routing to ensure each private subnet has a route to a NAT
   gateway.

6. Comparison with NAT instances: Prior to NAT gateways, users had to set up their own NAT instances
   (EC2 instances configured to perform NAT). NAT gateways are the preferred solution due to their
   automatic scaling, patching, and higher bandwidth.

7. Cost: There is an hourly charge for each provisioned NAT gateway and data processing charges for
   each gigabyte processed through the gateway.

So in summary, NAT gateways provide a managed, scalable way to enable outbound internet access for
instances in private subnets while shielding them from inbound connections. They are a key component
in building secure, multi-tier architectures in AWS where instances in private subnets need
controlled access to the internet.

Based on the provided search results, here are the main use cases for AWS NAT (Network Address
Translation) Gateways:

1. Enabling outbound internet access for private subnets:

- NAT Gateways allow instances in private subnets to send outbound traffic to the internet while
  preventing the internet from initiating inbound connections to those instances.[1][2][4]
- This enables private instances to perform tasks like downloading updates, accessing APIs, or
  fetching data without being directly exposed to the internet.[4]

1. Simplifying network architecture and management:

- NAT Gateways eliminate the need for bastion hosts or VPN connections to access private
  instances.[4]
- They are fully managed by AWS, automatically scaling based on usage and designed for high
  availability.[2][4]
- This simplifies network setup and reduces administrative overhead compared to managing your own
  NAT instances.[4]

1. Improving security for private resources:

- By allowing only outbound internet access, NAT Gateways reduce the attack surface for instances in
  private subnets.[2][4]
- They keep private instances isolated from direct internet access, minimizing the risk of
  unauthorized inbound connections.[4]

1. Enabling communication with on-premises networks using allow-listed IPs:

- Private NAT Gateways can enable VPC resources to communicate with on-premises networks using a
  pool of allow-listed IP addresses.[1]
- Instead of assigning separate allow-listed IPs to each instance, traffic can be routed through a
  NAT Gateway with an IP from the approved range.[1]

1. Facilitating communication between peered VPCs:

- Private NAT Gateways can enable communication between resources in peered VPCs that don't have
  public internet gateways.[4]
- This allows private resources in different VPCs to communicate without traversing the public
  internet.

In summary, NAT Gateways provide a secure, scalable, and managed solution for enabling outbound
internet access, simplifying network architecture, and facilitating communication between private
resources and external networks. They are a key component in building secure and highly available
architectures on AWS.
