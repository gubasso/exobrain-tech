# AWS SQS / AWS SNS

**Key Differences Between AWS SNS and AWS SQS**

| Feature             | AWS SQS                                                                                                    | AWS SNS                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Messaging Pattern   | Queue (Point-to-Point): One producer, one consumer per message.                                            | Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub): One producer, multiple subscribers receive each message.                                    |
| Message Delivery    | Pull-Based: Consumers poll the queue to retrieve messages when ready.                                      | Push-Based: Messages are pushed to subscribers as they are published.                                                    |
| Message Persistence | Messages are stored in the queue until they are processed and deleted by consumers.                        | Messages are not stored; they are delivered to subscribers and then discarded.                                           |
| Delivery Guarantee  | At-Least-Once: Messages are delivered at least once; duplicates are possible.                              | Best-Effort: Attempts to deliver messages to all subscribers; no built-in retry for failed deliveries unless configured. |
| Message Ordering    | Supports FIFO queues for strict message ordering.                                                          | Does not guarantee message order; messages may arrive out of sequence.                                                   |
| Use Case Focus      | Decoupling components and buffering messages for asynchronous processing by a single consumer per message. | Broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers or triggering multiple downstream processes simultaneously.                |
