- backups are not part of the capacity of your Storage Box.

"Services" -> "OCC". You can then execute these commands:

- Trash bin contents:

  ```
  trashbin:cleanup --all-users
  ```

- File versions:

  ```
  versions:cleanup %USER%
  ```

- You can show the users with the following OCC command:

  ```
  user:list
  ```
