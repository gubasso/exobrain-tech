## General

```
-r, --repo repository            repository to backup to or restore from (default: $RESTIC_REPOSITORY)
--repository-file file       file to read the repository location from (default: $RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE)
--password-command command   shell command to obtain the repository password from (default: $RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND)
```

- -r is it the location of the backup (destination, actual backup)

Calling restic in this way, the shell starts `gpg` and provides restic with file descriptor that it
can read like a file.[^1]

```
restic --password-file <( gpg --decrypt path-to-key.gpg ) backup [...]
gpg --decrypt blablabla | restic -r /path/to/repo snapshots
```
