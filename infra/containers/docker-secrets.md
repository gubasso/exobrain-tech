# Docker Secrets

Person:

- at my compose.yaml file I have this service:

```yaml
api:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: ./Dockerfiles/brag-server/Dockerfile
  entrypoint: ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
  volumes:
    - ./entrypoint.sh:/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
  secrets:
    - database_url
```

And this `secrets` section:

```yaml
secrets:
  postgres_password:
    environment: "POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
  database_url:
    environment: "DATABASE_URL"
```

at the `entrypoint.sh` file, I have this content that is supposed to load the `DATABASE_URL` env
variable to be available inside the container, to the binary that will be executed:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Read text from secret file
DATABASE_URL="$(cat /run/secrets/database_url)"
export DATABASE_URL
# Call the original entrypoint script
...
```

How do I finish this `entrypoint.sh` file correctly so the only thing it does is to load this
environment variable and continue the normal docker execution?

ChatGPT:

- To finish your `entrypoint.sh` script in a way that loads the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
  from a Docker secret and then continues with the normal Docker execution, you need to execute the
  original command passed to the Docker container. This is typically done by using the `exec`
  command in the shell script to replace the current shell with the specified command.

Here's how you can modify your `entrypoint.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read text from secret file and export it as an environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="$(cat /run/secrets/database_url)"

# Execute the command passed as arguments to the entrypoint script
exec "$@"
```

In this script:

1. The `export DATABASE_URL=...` line reads the content of the `database_url` secret and exports it
   as an environment variable.
2. The `exec "$@"` line is crucial. The `"$@"` is a shell parameter that expands to the original
   command-line arguments (preserving any spaces and special characters). The `exec` command
   replaces the current shell with the command you're executing, which is the standard way to end an
   `entrypoint.sh` script. This ensures that the command Docker was originally going to run (defined
   in the Dockerfile's `CMD` or overridden in the `docker-compose.yml`) is executed as the main
   process of the container.

By using this approach, your `entrypoint.sh` script sets up the environment variable from the Docker
secret and then proceeds to execute the container's main process as if the `entrypoint.sh` script
weren't there, which is typically what you want in a custom entrypoint script.

Person:

- Ok... I saw an example of this explanation for a postgresql docker image... and the
  `entrypoint.sh` that was given was like this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Read text from secret file
DATABASE_URL="$(cat /run/secrets/database_url)"
export DATABASE_URL
# Call the original entrypoint script
exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres
```

Why did this example user the last line as it is instead of just `exec "$@"`?

ChatGPT:

- The difference in how the last line of the `entrypoint.sh` script is written—using
  `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres` instead of `exec "$@"`—depends on the specific requirements
  or intentions of the Docker image and how it's supposed to be used.

In the case of the PostgreSQL Docker image, or similar cases, here are some possible reasons for
using `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`:

1. **Specific Entry Point** : The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script is a well-known script in many
   official Docker images, including PostgreSQL. This script is designed to set up the environment
   and prepare the service (in this case, PostgreSQL) to run correctly. By explicitly calling
   `docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`, the custom `entrypoint.sh` ensures that the original setup
   process for PostgreSQL is followed.
2. **Default Command** : The `postgres` argument is likely the default command that would be used to
   start the PostgreSQL server. If most users of the image will be using this default, then
   hardcoding it into the custom entrypoint script simplifies usage and ensures consistency.
3. **Control Over Command** : Using `exec "$@"` would execute whatever command is passed to the
   Docker container. In some scenarios, you might want more control over what command gets executed,
   especially if you are setting up a specialized environment or have specific requirements.
   Hardcoding the command (like `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres`) ensures that your environment
   setup is always followed by the execution of a specific, intended command.
4. **Customization for Specific Use-Cases** : Sometimes, the default behavior of the Docker image
   might not perfectly align with the needs of a specific project. In such cases, a custom
   `entrypoint.sh` allows for tweaking the startup process or the environment before executing the
   intended primary process.

To summarize, using `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres` is a more targeted approach, ensuring that
the PostgreSQL service starts with the expected configuration and environment. It's a way to combine
custom setup steps (like setting environment variables from Docker secrets) with the standard
initialization process of the PostgreSQL Docker image.
