## 1. Introduction to gocryptfs

gocryptfs implements **file-based encryption** entirely in user space, mounting an encrypted
directory (`CIPHERDIR`) to a plaintext view (`MOUNTPOINT`) via FUSE. It was designed to address
security concerns in earlier tools like EncFS and has matured through extensive stress testing and
correctness checks ([Arch Manual Pages][3], [maketecheasier][4]).

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **FUSE support**: gocryptfs requires a FUSE implementation (`fuse3` or `fuse2`) to be installed
  and the kernel module loaded ([ArchWiki][1]).
- **Unix-like OS**: Linux (native), macOS (beta), or WSL on Windows.
- **Privileges**: Ability to install packages and load kernel modules (typically via `sudo`).

---

## 3. Installation (Arch Linux)

```bash
sudo pacman -S gocryptfs
```

## 4. Initializing an Encrypted Directory

1. **Create directories** for your encrypted data and its mount point:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/vault_encrypted
   mkdir -p ~/vault_plain
   ```

2. **Initialize the encrypted directory**:

   ```bash
   gocryptfs -init ~/vault_encrypted
   ```

   This generates a `gocryptfs.conf` file containing your encrypted master key and salt, secured by
   your passphrase ([Arch Manual Pages][6], [ArchWiki][1]).

3. **Change passphrase** (optional):

   ```bash
   gocryptfs -passwd ~/vault_encrypted
   ```

   This prompts for the current and new passphrases, backing up the old config to
   `gocryptfs.conf.bak` ([Arch Manual Pages][6], [ArchWiki][1]).

---

## 5. Mounting and Unmounting

### 5.1 Manual Mount

```bash
gocryptfs ~/vault_encrypted ~/vault_plain
```

- To allow other users to access the mount, use:

  ```bash
  gocryptfs -o allow_other ~/vault_encrypted ~/vault_plain
  ```

  (Ensure `user_allow_other` is enabled in `/etc/fuse.conf`.) ([Arch Manual Pages][6],
  [Arch Manual Pages][3])

### 5.2 Unmount

```bash
fusermount -u ~/vault_plain
# or
umount ~/vault_plain
```

Unmounting flushes all writes and detaches the decrypted view ([Arch Manual Pages][6],
[Arch Manual Pages][3]).

---

## 6. Automating Mount Checks in Bash

To avoid duplicate mounts, use a script that checks if the mount point is active before mounting
([Baeldung][7], [Stack Overflow][8]):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

MOUNTPOINT=~/vault_plain
CRYPTDIR=~/vault_encrypted

if mountpoint -q "$MOUNTPOINT"; then
  echo "Vault already mounted at $MOUNTPOINT"
else
  echo "Mounting vault..."
  gocryptfs -o allow_other "$CRYPTDIR" "$MOUNTPOINT"
fi
```

- `mountpoint -q`: checks if the directory is a mount point.
- Alternatively, `grep -q " $MOUNTPOINT " /proc/mounts`.

---

## 7. Advanced Usage

- **Reverse mode** (`-reverse`): Mount a plaintext directory as an encrypted view, useful for
  on-the-fly encrypted backups. It uses deterministic AES-SIV rather than AES-GCM to ensure stable
  filenames ([Nuetzlich][9], [LinuxLinks][2]).
- **Long filename support** (`-longnames`): Enable handling of base64-encoded names up to 255 bytes
  by storing overflow names in `.name` files (default enabled) ([Go Packages][10], [GitHub][11]).
- **Filename padding**: Random padding obfuscates exact file sizes by padding encrypted
  filenames—helpful for privacy on cloud storage ([Nuetzlich][12]).
- **Master key mounting** (`-masterkey`): Mount directly with a raw master key (in hex or via
  `stdin`) if you’ve lost your passphrase but retained the key. Note the security risk of passing
  keys on the command line ([LinuxLinks][2]).

---

## 8. GUI Front-End: SiriKali

[SiriKali](https://mhogomchungu.github.io/sirikali/) is a Qt/C++ GUI that manages gocryptfs (and
other FUSE backends) visually:

1. **Install via Flatpak**:

   ```bash
   flatpak install flathub io.github.mhogomchungu.sirikali
   ```

2. **Launch SiriKali**, click **“Add”**, choose the gocryptfs backend, configure your encrypted
   folder and mount point, then click **Mount** or **Unmount** as needed
   ([Flathub - Apps for Linux][13], [Mhogo Mchungu][14]).

---

## 9. Best Practices & Troubleshooting

- **Back up your `gocryptfs.conf`** outside the encrypted directory to prevent total data loss if
  it’s corrupted ([ArchWiki][1]).
- **Use a strong passphrase** to leverage the full strength of Scrypt key derivation
  ([Nuetzlich][15]).
- **Always unmount** before shutting down to avoid possible corruption.
- **FUSE errors** (e.g., “Permission denied”): ensure the `fuse` module is loaded
  (`sudo modprobe fuse`) and that your user is in the `fuse` group ([ArchWiki][1]).
