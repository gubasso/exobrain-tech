## Issue description

Trying to do git operations on multiple remote gitolite repositories... It also happened when I
changed the remotes to gitlab (the issue was not with gitolite itself)

git push doesn't work... but the GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git push works...

```text
❯ git push
FATAL: W any example-user/password-store example-user DENIED by fallthru
(or you mis-spelled the reponame)
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

```text
❯ GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git push
OpenSSH_9.6p1, OpenSSL 3.1.4 24 Oct 2023
...
...
...
Everything up-to-date
```

at the repo:

```text
❯ git config --list
user.email=you@example.com
user.name=Example User
core.sshcommand=ssh -oControlMaster=auto -oControlPersist=600 -oControlPath=/tmp/.ssh-%C
...
...
...
```

### Basic issue explanation and possible solutions

ChatGPT:

Based on the information you've provided, it seems that the default `git push` command fails because
the SSH connection isn't being established correctly. However, when you specify the
`GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v"` environment variable, the `git push` works as expected. The primary
difference here is the verbosity and perhaps the specific configuration being loaded when you
manually specify the SSH command.

1. **Custom SSH Configuration:**

Your `.ssh/config` file is likely being used when you run `GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git push`. This
file contains custom configurations that are critical for connecting to the server correctly. Here
is the relevant part from the verbose output:

```arduino
debug1: $HOME/.ssh/config line 66: Applying options for git-org-user
```

This suggests that your `.ssh/config` has a section specifically for `git-org-user`. However,
when you run `git push` without `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, it might not be using the same configurations.

This is the default git configuration for each repo (local config):

```bash
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600 -o ControlPath=/tmp/.ssh-%C"
```

Alternatively, you can globally set this configuration:

```bash
git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600 -o ControlPath=/tmp/.ssh-%C"
```

1. **SSH Control Path Issues:**

Your SSH configuration uses a control path option (`ControlPath=/tmp/.ssh-%C`), which means that SSH
connection multiplexing is enabled. This can sometimes cause issues if there are leftover control
master sockets or if the paths are not accessible or too long.

**Solution:**

Clean up any existing SSH control sockets:

```bash
sudo find /tmp -type s -name '.ssh-*' -delete
```

Ensure that the control path is accessible and not too long. You could also change the `ControlPath`
to a simpler one, such as:

```bash
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600 -o ControlPath=~/.ssh/git-%r@%h:%p"
```

### Tried to solve deleting tmp cache

You:

both ids are correctly loaded at the ssh agent:

```text
❯ ssh-add -l
...
...
...
...
```

at the repository "root"

```text
❯ git push
Everything up-to-date
```

at the repository example-repo

```text
example-repo on  master
❯ git push
FATAL: W any example-user/password-store example-user DENIED by fallthru
(or you mis-spelled the reponame)
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

then I clean the temp files...

```text
example-repo on  master
❯ sudo find /tmp -type s -name '.ssh-*' -delete
```

and try again at example-repo:

```text
❯ git push
Everything up-to-date
```

it works correctly.... but now when I try at the repository "root"

```text
root on  master
❯ git push
FATAL: W any example-user/password-store example-user DENIED by fallthru
(or you mis-spelled the reponame)
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

it doesn't work...

### Understanding the Problem

ChatGPT:

It appears that your issue is related to SSH multiplexing and possibly some caching problems with
your SSH agent or the SSH control socket files. When you delete the SSH control socket files, the
push works temporarily, but it fails again when switching between repositories.

1. **SSH Control Socket and Multiplexing:**

- You have SSH multiplexing enabled, which reuses a single SSH connection for multiple git
  operations. This setup is controlled by the `ControlMaster`, `ControlPath`, and `ControlPersist`
  options in your SSH configuration.

- When you delete the control socket files (`/tmp/.ssh-*`), you're effectively resetting any
  existing SSH sessions, forcing new connections to be established.

1. **Different Repository Configurations:**

- Each repository might be connecting to a different remote, which could require different SSH keys
  or different configurations. The error messages you see (`DENIED by fallthru`) suggest that the
  server-side access control is denying access due to incorrect identification or authorization.

1. **SSH Agent and Identity Issues:**

- Both SSH keys are loaded into the SSH agent, but it's possible that the wrong key is being used
  when switching between repositories due to the multiplexed connection.

## Solutions

The problem was related to SSH multiplexing, which reuses existing SSH connections for multiple
operations, potentially causing conflicts when switching between repositories.

### 0) Disable SSH multiplexing by unsetting core.sshcommand

The best solution.

```sh
git config --unset core.sshCommand
```

### 1) Disable SSH Multiplexing Temporarily (for each repo locally)

To confirm that SSH multiplexing is the issue, you can temporarily disable it for your git
operations. This can be done by overriding the `core.sshCommand` for the repository.For the `root`
repository:

```bash
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -o ControlMaster=no"
```

For the `example-repo` repository:

```bash
git config core.sshCommand "ssh -o ControlMaster=no"
```

This will disable SSH multiplexing for these repositories and force a new connection for each
`git push`. If this resolves the issue, it confirms that SSH multiplexing was causing the problem.2.

Great to hear that disabling SSH multiplexing resolved the issue for you! By setting
`core.sshCommand "ssh -o ControlMaster=no"` for each repository, you've effectively ensured that
each `git push` operation establishes a new SSH connection without reusing an existing one. This
avoids any conflicts or caching problems that may have been caused by SSH multiplexing.

By disabling SSH multiplexing (`ControlMaster=no`), each `git push` operation now creates a new SSH
connection, ensuring the correct SSH identity and configuration is used for each repository.
