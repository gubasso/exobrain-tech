# Isolated AI Dev Environment Automated Wrappers

Since writing the original
[walkthrough](./isolated-ai-dev-environment-with-systemd-nspawn-dev-sandbox.md), I implemented three
small wrapper scripts that automate the workflows described here. They cover three operational
models (persistent machine, one-shot session, and per-project containers).

**Scripts**

- **`dev-sandbox`** — long-lived `systemd-nspawn` machine (persistent rootfs, multi-terminal attach)
  Link: _https://github.com/gubasso/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/bin/dev-sandbox_
- **`dev-sandbox-oneshot`** — one-shot `systemd-nspawn` entry into an existing rootfs (single
  session) Link:
  _https://github.com/gubasso/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/bin/dev-sandbox-oneshot_
- **`dev-container`** — rootless Podman, per-project persistent containers (multi-terminal attach)

### Quick comparison

| Dimension                         | dev-sandbox                                                                                                       | dev-sandbox-oneshot                                                                      | dev-container                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core model                        | systemd-nspawn, persistent rootfs                                                                                 | systemd-nspawn, single-session                                                           | Podman, per-project containers                                                                                                                              |
| Primary goal                      | Long-lived, stable dev machine with repeatable multi-terminal attach and project binds                            | Fast, minimal “enter once” experience using an existing rootfs and direct nspawn exec    | Rootless, per-project isolated containers with multi-terminal attach and per-project config volume                                                          |
| Isolation model                   | One machine (“dev-sandbox”) with a persistent rootfs under `/var/lib/machines/dev-sandbox`                        | Same rootfs location model, but does not manage lifecycle; just enters                   | One container per project path (plus optional base shell container); container state per project                                                            |
| Host requirements                 | `machinectl`, `systemd-run`, `systemd-nspawn`, `zypper`, `rpm`, `sudo`, etc.                                      | `systemd-nspawn` + rootfs already provisioned; minimal host-side orchestration           | Rootless `podman` + `rsync` (unless `--no-sync`), `readlink`, etc.                                                                                          |
| Persistence scope                 | Highest: rootfs persists across reboots; machine can be enabled; consistent base environment                      | High (rootfs persists), but script itself is not the lifecycle manager                   | Medium: container persists per project, but changes are scoped to that project container (not shared across projects); image rebuilds affect new containers |
| Multi-terminal support            | Yes: `systemd-run -M ... --pty` enables many concurrent shells into the same running machine                      | No (by design): “one terminal session at a time” workflow                                | Yes: re-run script to `podman exec -it` into the same container (concurrent terminals supported)                                                            |
| Project mount behavior            | Per-invocation bind to `/workspace/<basename>` with collision checks and mountpoint validation                    | Per-invocation bind to `/workspace/<project-name>`                                       | Per-project bind mount into `/workspace/<basename>` (RW) for project mode                                                                                   |
| Basename collision handling       | Explicit collision detection; expects consistent mapping per basename; rejects ambiguous bindings                 | No collision management beyond what systemd-nspawn does for bind args                    | Avoids basename collisions via per-project container naming (`<basename>-<hash(path)>`) while mountpoint path stays `/workspace/<basename>`                 |
| User identity strategy            | Mirrors host username + UID/GID inside container (may delete conflicting users/groups by policy)                  | Uses fixed users (e.g., `dev`) and optionally root; no UID/GID mirroring                 | Uses `--userns=keep-id` + `--user UID:GID`; no in-container user creation required (identity mapping via Podman)                                            |
| Host config strategy              | Sync host `~/.config` into rootfs `/home/<hostuser>/.config` on each attach (rsync, potentially privileged write) | Bind-mount dotfiles read-only into `/opt/host-dotfiles*`; does not sync host `~/.config` | Sync host `~/.config` one-way into a _per-container_ volume (merge semantics, no deletes); symlinks dereferenced                                            |
| Typical “safe AI tooling” posture | Strong: tools installed in container; host exposure mediated via binds and user mapping                           | Strong but simpler: read-only dotfiles + optional project bind; minimal orchestration    | Strong: rootless containers reduce host privilege; per-project isolation limits blast radius                                                                |
| Lifecycle operations              | Full: provision rootfs, manage machine start/stop/status/setup, enable machine                                    | Minimal: requires rootfs exists; no provision/start/stop management                      | Container lifecycle: create/start/stop/rm/list; image build/rebuild support                                                                                 |
| Best fit                          | Daily driver sandbox machine; stable baseline; frequent multi-terminal workflows across many projects             | Quick “jump in” single session when rootfs already exists; simpler mental model          | Per-project environments; rootless workflow; easy isolation across many projects; acceptable that state differs between projects                            |
