# Systemd: Wants/WantedBy dependency

Once your unit file includes:

```ini
[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

you only need to run:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now keepassxc.service
```

- `enable` installs the symlink into `graphical-session.target.wants/` as specified by your
  `WantedBy=` line
- `WantedBy=graphical-session.target` – install-time “reverse” dependency
- `graphical-session.target` is a special user target that is active for any Wayland or X11 session;
  services that are only useful in a GUI are typically attached here .
- The `--now` flag tells systemd to **also start** the service immediately, combining what would
  otherwise be separate `enable` + `start` commands
- After that, KeePassXC will be pulled in and started automatically whenever your graphical session
  (i.e. `graphical-session.target`) is activated.

`After=waybar.service` – runtime ordering only

- `After=` (and its twin `Before=`) tell systemd **when** to start one unit _relative to_ another,
  but they do **not** create any dependency by themselves – if no one asks for _both_ units, nothing
  happens
- In your KeePassXC unit this makes the service wait until Waybar has reached the “started” state
  before it launches, preventing the classic tray-icon race

---

_Need automatic start at login?_ → Keep `WantedBy=graphical-session.target` **or**
`add-wants niri.service …`. → Use **one** of the two wiring methods (WantedBy _or_ add-wants) and
avoid duplicating links. _Need to guarantee the tray is present first?_ → Keep
`After=waybar.service`.

With this mental model—**ordering (`After=`) vs pulling (`Wants=`/symlinks)**—you can reason about
any other user-unit relationship in your Arch + Niri setup.

## Summary

Both `systemctl --user add-wants niri.service keepassxc.service` and declaring

```ini
[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

serve the **same underlying mechanism**—they create a _Wants=_ dependency via symlinks—yet they
differ only in **which unit** becomes the “puller.” You can choose either approach interchangeably
**if** you’re happy with the same parent unit wanting your KeePassXC service.

---

## How they work under the hood

- **`Wants=` vs. `WantedBy=`** In systemd, a `Wants=` line in a unit’s `[Unit]` section defines a
  soft dependency, while `WantedBy=` in `[Install]` tells `systemctl enable` where to drop the
  symlink so that activating that target will pull in your service
  ([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][1]).
- **`systemctl --user add-wants`** This CLI command programmatically creates the identical kind of
  symlink (in `~/.config/systemd/user/<target>.wants/`), without you having to edit unit files or
  run `enable` ([Debian Manpages][2]).

## What’s the only real difference?

| Method                                     | Puller Unit                | Symlink location                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `add-wants niri.service keepassxc.service` | `niri.service`             | `~/.config/systemd/user/niri.service.wants/keepassxc.service` ([Debian Manpages][2])                         |
| `WantedBy=graphical-session.target`        | `graphical-session.target` | `~/.config/systemd/user/graphical-session.target.wants/keepassxc.service` ([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][1]) |

## When to pick which

- **Tie to Niri only** If you want KeePassXC to follow the lifecycle of **just** your Niri
  compositor (start/stop/restart), use:

  ```bash
  systemctl --user add-wants niri.service keepassxc.service
  ```

  ([Debian Manpages][2])

- **Tie to any graphical session** If you prefer KeePassXC to launch whenever **any** graphical
  session is active (not just Niri), include in your unit:

  ```ini
  [Install]
  WantedBy=graphical-session.target
  ```

  ([Arch Linux Forums][3])

---

## Key takeaway

You **can** use **either** approach to achieve the same “KeePassXC is wanted by X” effect—just pick
the parent unit (`niri.service` vs. `graphical-session.target`) that best matches when you really
want KeePassXC to come up.
