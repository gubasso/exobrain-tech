# Opensuse Tumbleweed Installation Settings

## Booting

When setting up a new installation of openSUSE Tumbleweed, there are several booting settings to
consider, particularly regarding Secure Boot, Trusted Boot, and updating NVRAM. Here are the
recommendations based on current information:

### Secure Boot

- **Recommendation**: **Disable Secure Boot** during installation.
- **Reason**: While openSUSE Tumbleweed has made progress in supporting Secure Boot, there are
  ongoing issues that may require Secure Boot to be disabled, especially for installing firmware
  updates via `fwupd`[1]. Some users have reported boot issues when Secure Boot is enabled,
  resulting in a need to toggle it on and off to resolve boot errors[2].

### Trusted Boot

- ENABLE: It allows for LUKS to require just one password
- **Recommendation**: This setting is less commonly discussed in the context of openSUSE Tumbleweed
  installations. Generally, Trusted Boot is not a requirement for most users and can be left
  disabled unless specific security policies or requirements dictate otherwise.

### Update NVRAM

- **Recommendation**: **Disable updating NVRAM** during installation.
- **Reason**: By disabling the update of NVRAM, you can prevent the boot order from being
  overwritten during kernel or bootloader updates. This is particularly useful if you have a
  specific boot order preference, such as dual-booting with another operating system like Windows
  [5] [6].

These settings help ensure a smoother installation and operation of openSUSE Tumbleweed,
particularly in environments where firmware updates and boot order stability are important.
