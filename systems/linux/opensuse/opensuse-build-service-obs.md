## Companion subtree (canonical OBS/osc notes)

- [`tools/osc-obs/`](../../../tools/osc-obs/README.md) — dedicated OBS/osc
  subtree:
  - [`setup-home-project-from-upstream.md`](../../../tools/osc-obs/setup-home-project-from-upstream.md)
    — from-scratch home-project walkthrough (project meta, base import vs branch, satellite
    `_link` + `<apply>`, branched providers, verification sequence).
  - [`broken-state-link-drift.md`](../../../tools/osc-obs/broken-state-link-drift.md) — the `broken`
    lane state (pre-build link-expansion failure), diagnostic recipe, and
    `osc add`/`osc rm`/`osc ci` recovery.
  - `auth-in-devcontainers.md` (path: `../../../tools/osc-obs/auth-in-devcontainers.md`) — auth / `oscrc` /
    KWallet-free credential setup in devcontainers.
  - [`common-mistakes-and-pitfalls.md`](../../../tools/osc-obs/common-mistakes-and-pitfalls.md) —
    distilled lessons from real incidents (auth, workspace, CLI foot-guns, patch/link evolution,
    diagnostic discipline).
  - [`libexpat-source-naming.md`](../../../tools/osc-obs/libexpat-source-naming.md) — the
    `libexpat1` binary RPM ships from source pkg `expat`; `osc branch` with target-rename trick;
    cross-project version / CVE-2025-59375 patch matrix; why `SUSE:SLE-15-SP<n>:Update` beats
    `openSUSE:Factory` for SLES overlay work.
  - [`case-studies/`](../../../tools/osc-obs/case-studies/README.md) — narrative reflections on real
    OBS home-project incidents (goal → mistakes → fix → rule distilled → happy path → final result).
    Read once per topic to install the lesson; the topic notes above are the reference cards. Covers
    `broken` link drift after a patch rename, and overriding a buildroot ABI by branching a SUSE
    Update package into the home project.

## General

```text
Sometimes, you will see the obs://DOMAIN/PROJECT notation. The obs:// schema is a shorthand to abbreviate the long URL and needs to be replaced by the real OBS instance URL.

## Contribution flow at a glance

The standard openSUSE contribution path, from a home project:

1. Browse the source package page on `build.opensuse.org`.
2. Create a personal branch into your home project (`osc branch`).
3. Edit the spec / add a `PatchN:` for your fix.
4. Build locally to verify (`osc build`).
5. Commit (`osc commit`) and wait for the OBS build to go green.
6. Submit a request back to the origin project (`osc sr`).

Detailed walkthroughs are in `tools/osc-obs/setup-home-project-from-upstream.md`
(full home-project setup) and `tools/osc-obs/obs-github-coordination.md`
(upstream-PR-vs-OBS-patch lifecycle).
