# ebpf

- event driven

- javascript -> browser

- ebpf -> kernel

- run custom programs inside the kernel

- load them dynamically into the kernel

- attach them to any event on the system

- inject simple programs to the kernel

- run programs in linux kernel

  - in a sandboxed vm
  - isolate the risk

- jit compiling

- extend kernel functionality safely

- performance advantages

  - runs at logical junction
  - take decisions early
  - no performance degradation

Use cases

- networking

  - filtering , ...
  - analyse

- observability

  - with minimal process costs

- security policies

  - kill processes
  - restric behavious
  - filter traffic

- kernel patching

- kernel drivers

- tracing

- ebpf programs:

  - can be attached to different kernel entities:
    - sockets
    - kprobes: kernel functions
    - uprobes: userspace functions
    - tracepoints
    - lsm_hooks (LSM: Linux Security Modules) ...

- ebpf map

  - storage in the kernel
  - shared between kernel and user space
  - a lot of types
  - to declare it:
    - bpf map type
    - max number of elements
    - key size (in bytes)
    - value size (in bytes)

- BCC bpf compiler collection (python)

  - set of tools

- rust libraries:

  - libbpf-rs (ebpf code is still in C)
  - aya, everything in Rust, even eBPF programs

- ebpf projects written in rust:

  - bpfd
  - pulsar

- writing a program:

  - ebpf program itself
  - loading, and managing the life cycle

- XDP: eXpress Data Path
