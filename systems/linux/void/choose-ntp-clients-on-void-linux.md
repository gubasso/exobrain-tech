# Choose NTP Clients on Void Linux

## Summary

Among the four NTP implementations available on Void Linux—ISC-ntpd, OpenNTPD, Chrony, and
ntpd-rs—**Chrony** emerges as the de facto choice for users seeking a reliable, low-maintenance time
synchronizer. Although Void Linux does not publish client-specific popularity metrics, Chrony’s fast
convergence, high accuracy under varying network conditions, and widespread adoption as the default
NTP client in many major distributions strongly suggest it is the most used by the Void community
([docs.voidlinux.org][1], [octothorn.com][2]).

## Available NTP Clients on Void Linux

### ISC-ntpd

The official reference implementation of the Network Time Protocol, ISC-ntpd delivers comprehensive
feature support—including broadcast and multicast modes—but typically requires more extensive
configuration and ongoing maintenance to secure and optimize its operation
([docs.voidlinux.org][1]).

### OpenNTPD

OpenNTPD focuses on lean, secure time synchronization with minimal configuration. It “just works”
for the majority of straightforward use cases, though it offers fewer advanced tuning options and
slightly lower precision compared to Chrony and ISC-ntpd ([docs.voidlinux.org][1]).

### Chrony

Designed for fast synchronization and robust performance in environments with intermittent
connectivity (e.g., laptops switching networks), Chrony achieves rapid convergence to the correct
time and maintains high accuracy with minimal user tuning required ([docs.voidlinux.org][1],
[pimylifeup.com][3]).

### ntpd-rs

A modern Rust-based implementation supporting Network Time Security (NTS), ntpd-rs is full-featured
but still maturing; it may require additional troubleshooting and lacks the battle-testing of the
other three daemons ([docs.voidlinux.org][1]).

## Community Adoption and Recommendation

- **Wider Linux Ecosystem:** Chrony has replaced ISC-ntpd as the default NTP client in many leading
  distributions—including RHEL and its derivatives—due to its superior speed and ease of maintenance
  ([octothorn.com][2], [howtouselinux.com][4]).
- **Void Documentation:** Void’s own Handbook lists all four daemons neutrally, but community
  discussion in the Void Linux docs GitHub (issue #123) highlights Chrony’s straightforward
  integration and minimal configuration, reinforcing its reputation for low upkeep
  ([github.com][5]).

## Which One to Choose

- **Chrony:** Best overall balance of speed, accuracy, and “set-and-forget” operation—highly
  recommended for most Void Linux users ([docs.voidlinux.org][1], [octothorn.com][2]).
- **OpenNTPD:** Opt for maximum simplicity and lowest resource use if you only need basic
  synchronization and can tolerate slightly less precision ([docs.voidlinux.org][1]).
- **ISC-ntpd:** Choose when you require advanced NTP features (e.g., broadcast/multicast) and are
  comfortable with more detailed configuration and periodic maintenance ([docs.voidlinux.org][1]).
- **ntpd-rs:** Consider if you want cutting-edge NTS support in a modern codebase and are willing to
  troubleshoot a less mature project ([docs.voidlinux.org][1]).

clients:
