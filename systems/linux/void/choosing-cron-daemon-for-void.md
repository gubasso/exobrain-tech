# Choosing CRON Daemon for Void

## Summary

Based on Void’s official handbook, community installation guides, and upstream project activity,
**dcron** emerges as the de-facto cron implementation for Void Linux users seeking minimal
maintenance and reliable behavior ([docs.voidlinux.org][1], [0ink.net][2]). While **Cronie** is
actively maintained by the Fedora/RHEL community, it is less commonly chosen in Void setups
([github.com][3]). **Fcron** offers advanced scheduling features but has seen few updates since its
2016 release ([en.wikipedia.org][4]). Alternatives like **snooze** and **supercronic** address niche
scenarios (e.g., simple one-off waits or crontab-only operation without a local MTA) but have
smaller user bases and require custom runit service scripts ([voidlinux.org][5],
[tech.0x5e00.com][6]). For broad community support, seamless runit integration, and low upkeep,
**dcron** is the recommended choice.

---

## Available Cron Implementations on Void

Void’s official handbook documents multiple cron implementations available via XBPS:

- **cronie**: A modern fork of Vixie-cron with SELinux/PAM support.
- **dcron**: Dillon’s lightweight cron daemon compatible with standard `cron` syntax.
- **fcron**: An integrated cron+anacron replacement offering load-average and execution window
  controls. ([docs.voidlinux.org][1])
- **snooze**: A simple wait-and-exec utility used with `snooze-hourly`, `snooze-daily`, etc.
  ([docs.voidlinux.org][1])
- **supercronic**: A Go-based crontab interpreter that runs without root/MTA and logs to stdout
  ([tech.0x5e00.com][6])

---

## Community Adoption and Usage

- **dcron**

  - Chosen in multiple Void install guides for its lightweight footprint and correct handling of
    missed runs during power-off periods ([0ink.net][2], [hadet.dev][7]).
- **Cronie**

  - Actively developed (latest release 1.7.2 in April 2024) but less frequently selected by Void
    users ([github.com][3]).
- **Fcron**

  - Implements anacron-style behavior natively, but its last stable release was in June 2016
    (v3.2.1) with the next preview in December 2021 ([en.wikipedia.org][4]).
- **Snooze**

  - Stable since at least 2017 as part of Void’s `runit`-based scheduling alternatives, though
    adoption is limited to specific use cases ([voidlinux.org][5]).
- **Supercronic**

  - Provides crontab compatibility without requiring a local MTA, but remains a niche, manually
    installed solution ([tech.0x5e00.com][6]).

## Recommendation

To minimize upkeep and align with established Void community practices, install **dcron**:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -Sy dcron
ln -s /etc/sv/dcron /var/service
```

This setup delivers full `cron` compatibility, robust handling of missed intervals, and seamless
integration with Void’s `runit` service supervision—requiring virtually no extra configuration
beyond enabling the service ([0ink.net][2], [hadet.dev][7]).

## Summary: dcron vs cronie

dcron is a highly **lightweight**, **self-contained** cron daemon that integrates anacron-like
behavior into a minimal codebase, requiring only `/bin/sh` to run jobs—ideal for
resource-constrained systems and setups without PAM/SELinux demands ([linuxbash.sh][1],
[jimpryor.net][2]). In contrast, cronie is a **feature-rich**, **actively maintained** fork of
Vixie-cron that offers **PAM authentication**, **SELinux support**, robust **syslog** integration,
and native **anacron** tooling, at the cost of a larger footprint, extra dependencies, and more
complex configuration ([linuxbash.sh][1], [wiki.archlinux.org][3]).

---

## Overview

### dcron

- **Origin & Maintenance** Developed by Matt Dillon and maintained by James Pryor, dcron targets
  simplicity and minimalism in a secure scheduler ([github.com][4]).
- **Core Philosophy** Avoids the complexity of separate anacron; integrates missed-job handling
  directly into the daemon ([jimpryor.net][2]).

### cronie

- **Origin & Maintenance** A Fedora/RHEL community project, cronie is actively developed (v1.7.2
  released April 2024) and widely deployed on RHEL/CentOS systems ([github.com][5],
  [github.com][5]).
- **Core Philosophy** Builds on Vixie-cron’s proven foundation, extending it with modern security
  modules and logging capabilities.

---

## Pros of dcron

### 1. Lightweight Footprint

- dcron’s codebase is tiny (\~3 K LOC) and consumes minimal RAM/CPU, making it perfect for embedded
  or low-resource environments ([linuxbash.sh][1]).
- Unlike cronie, it has no PAM or SELinux dependencies, reducing install size and attack surface
  ([linuxbash.sh][1]).

### 2. Self-Contained Anacron Functionality

- Since v4.0, dcron includes built-in anacron-style features—no separate anacron binary needed
  ([jimpryor.net][2]).

### 3. Simplified Configuration & Dependencies

- Jobs run under `/bin/sh` without managing complex environment variables or shells
  ([packages.gentoo.org][6]).
- Configuration is limited to standard crontab syntax plus `@daily`/`@reboot` directives.

---

## Cons of dcron

### 1. Limited Security Integrations

- dcron does **not** support PAM authentication or SELinux confinement, making it unsuitable for
  environments requiring those security layers ([linuxbash.sh][1]).

### 2. Less Active Maintenance

- Upstream activity has slowed; the primary repository has seen few updates, and community patchsets
  (e.g., ptchinster’s fork) have emerged to fill the gap ([jimpryor.net][7]).

---

## Pros of cronie

### 1. Robust Security Integrations

- Native support for PAM modules and SELinux contexts ensures cron jobs adhere to system security
  policies ([linuxbash.sh][1]).

### 2. Native Anacron & Scheduled-jobs Directories

- Bundles anacron tool and automatically handles `/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}` jobs,
  ensuring periodic tasks run even after downtime ([wiki.archlinux.org][3]).

### 3. Active Upstream & Broad Adoption

- Versioned releases (e.g., 1.7.2 in April 2024) and inclusion as the default cron on RHEL/CentOS
  demonstrate its stability and community trust ([github.com][5]).

---

## Cons of cronie

### 1. Larger Footprint & Extra Dependencies

- Requires PAM libraries, SELinux policies, and optionally a mail transfer agent (MTA) for job
  output mailing, increasing disk and memory usage ([linuxbash.sh][1], [linuxbash.sh][1]).

### 2. Mailer Requirement or Silent Failure

- By default, cronie tries to email output via `sendmail`; if no MTA is installed, mail output is
  disabled without clear error ([wiki.archlinux.org][3]).

### 3. More Complex Configuration

- Integrating PAM and SELinux into cronjobs can demand additional context definitions and PAM stack
  adjustments, complicating maintenance ([docs.redhat.com][8]).

---

## Conclusion

- **Choose dcron** if you value a **minimal**, **fast**, and **self-contained** cron daemon with
  integrated anacron, especially on single-purpose or resource-limited systems.
- **Choose cronie** if your environment requires **advanced security**, **flexible logging**, and
  **native anacron/directories** support, and you’re comfortable with its additional dependencies
  and configuration complexity.
