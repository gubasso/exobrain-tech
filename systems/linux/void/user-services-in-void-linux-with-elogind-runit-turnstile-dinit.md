# User services in void linux with: elogind, runit, turnstile, dinit

## Solving this problem

1. After the system starts, I already am at tty1. I mean that I want niri to autostart after login,
   only if I am at tty1. I have this rule setup at .profile, but I want to know if
   turnstile/dinit/elogind can manage that instead of .profile

2. Let's focus on turnstile + dinit to make the declarative units a) computer starts and I am at
   tty1 ready for login (it already is set) b) type user/password -> correctly logged in. I need to
   setup niri to start automatically (.profile is already doing this, can I do this with
   turnstile/dinit/elogind instead? c) setup the startup sequence rules with
   turnstile/dinit/elogind: niri -> waybar -> keepassxc/nextcloud

## Solution

- **turnstile** injects a _per‑login_ instance of **dinit** as soon as PAM finishes authenticating
  you;
- dinit then enforces the graph **niri → waybar → {keepassxc, nextcloud}** with true readiness
  signalling, not arbitrary sleeps;
- niri starts only when you log in on **tty 1**, thanks to the `XDG_VTNR` variable that elogind (or
  logind‑compatible PAM) exports.

## Setup

### Enable the stack

```sh
sudo xbps-install -Sy turnstile dinit inotify-tools
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/turnstiled /var/service
sv status turnstiled # make sure the service is running
```

### Tell turnstile to use dinit (not the default runit backend)

Open `/etc/turnstile/turnstiled.conf` and make sure you have

```ini
backend = dinit
```

```sh
sudo sv restart turnstiled     # or: sv down/up turnstiled
```

### Check PAM: is `pam_turnstile.so` in the session stack?

Turnstile’s PAM module is what signals the daemon to start the per-user dinit when you log in
([Artix Linux Forum][5]).

You need **one** line like the following in either `/etc/pam.d/login` **or** the common file
inherited by it (`system-login` on Void):

```text
session   optional   pam_turnstile.so
```

Void’s `turnstile` package normally installs this line automatically; confirm it wasn’t
removed ([Artix Linux Forum][4]).

### Log out and back in (or switch VTs)

At every new login turnstile should now spawn a user instance:

```bash
pgrep -xu "$USER" dinit            # should print a PID
ls -l /run/user/$(id -u)/dinitctl  # control socket should exist
```

If those two checks pass, `dinitctl list` or `dinitctl enable boot` will work with no extra
flags ([GitHub][6], [Davmac][7]).

### User‑mode dinit base directory

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/dinit.d ~/.local/state/dinit
echo 'log-dir = $HOME/.local/state/dinit' > ~/.config/dinit.d/config
```

dinit looks here automatically when turnstile starts it.([wiki.artixlinux.org][3], [GitHub][4])

### Service files

```text
~/.config/dinit.d
├── boot
├── niri
│   ├── service
│   └── niri-wrapper.sh
├── waybar
│   └── service
├── keepassxc
│   └── service
└── nextcloud
    └── service
```

#### `boot` (milestone that comes up immediately)

```ini
type        = internal
depends-on  = niri
```

Everything else fans out from here.([about boot file][3])

#### `niri-wrapper.sh`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Launch niri only on tty1 and signal readiness via FD 3
if [ "$XDG_VTNR" != "1" ]; then
  exit 0            # session on another VT → do nothing, still succeed
fi

SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-1"
niri &                  # compositor in background
pid=$!

# inotifywait blocks until the socket actually appears – no polling loop
inotifywait -q -e create "$(dirname "$SOCK")" --format '' "${SOCK}" >&3
# newline written to FD 3 tells dinit “service is READY” (see ready‑notification)
wait $pid               # keep wrapper alive so dinit can supervise niri
```

Check how this `inotifywait` command works ([inotify][14])

#### `niri/service`

```ini
type              = process
command           = $SERVICE_DIR/niri-wrapper.sh
ready-notification = fd:3             # event‑driven readiness
logfile           = $HOME/.local/state/dinit/niri.log
restart           = true
```

Because `elogind`/PAM exports `XDG_VTNR`, the test is trivial.([freedesktop.org][5])

#### `waybar/service`

```ini
type         = process
depends-on   = niri
command      = waybar
logfile      = $HOME/.local/state/dinit/waybar.log
restart      = true
```

#### `keepassxc/service` (identical for nextcloud)

```ini
type         = process
depends-on   = waybar
command      = keepassxc
logfile      = $HOME/.local/state/dinit/keepassxc.log
restart      = true
```

### How _depends‑on_ really works in dinit

1. When a service lists `depends-on = X`, dinit _recursively_ activates **X** first.
2. It waits until **X** reaches the **started** state.

   - For _process_ services **without** a readiness hook the state flips as soon as the `exec()`
     succeeds.([wiki.artixlinux.org][3])
   - If `ready-notification` is set, dinit blocks until the child **writes one byte** to the
     provided pipe (FD 3 in our wrapper). This is identical to the s6 readiness model—no fixed
     timeout, no polling.([GitHub][6], [GitHub][6])
   - For `bgprocess`, readiness is implicit when the forking parent exits.([GitHub][7])
   - For `scripted`, the service is _ready_ when the script exits with 0.([GitHub][8])
3. After the dependency graph is satisfied dinit spawns the dependents; if any dependency later
   crashes, dinit also stops/restarts the dependents according to policy.([GitHub][9], [GitHub][10])

_**No arbitrary delay is ever inserted**_—readiness is event‑driven, giving you systemd‑style
determinism without the sleeper loops.

### Enabling, testing, controlling

Dinit launches the `boot` service automatically if you don’t name another initial service.

```sh
# first login after creating the files
dinitctl list                 # view graph and state
dinitctl log niri             # tail compositor logs
dinitcheck niri #checks for logs
```

If you switch to tty2 and log in, `$XDG_VTNR` will be 2; `niri-wrapper.sh` exits 0, so no compositor
or children start, yet the session still succeeds.

---

### Why not leave this in `.profile`?

- With turnstile + dinit every program runs under supervision and gains auto‑restart and
  logging.([Void Linux Documentation][11])
- The dependency graph is declarative and version‑controlled—no shell `if … then …` spaghetti.
- `elogind` still handles seat/VT switching and power keys; turnstile merely _adds_ user‑service
  orchestration.([Void Linux Documentation][2])

### Troubleshooting tips

| Symptom             | Check                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Waybar never starts | `dinitctl status niri` to confirm it reported **started**; if not, inspect `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-1` path.                           |
| Services not found  | Ensure `boot` service is **enabled**; user dinit won’t traverse the graph otherwise.                                                    |
| Need extra env vars | Add `env-file = $HOME/.config/dinit.d/env` to any service; dinit substitutes them at load time.([wiki.artixlinux.org][3], [GitHub][12]) |

#### If dinit **is** running but dinitctl still cannot find the socket

Occasionally the backend places the socket under `/run/turnstiled/$UID/dinitctl`; this was seen
after recent updates on Artix/turnstile ([Artix Linux Forum][8]). Two quick cures:

- **Point dinitctl at it explicitly**

  ```bash
  dinitctl -p /run/turnstiled/$(id -u)/dinitctl list
  ```

- **Or create a symlink** (works around old clients that look only in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`):

  ```bash
  ln -s /run/turnstiled/$(id -u)/dinitctl ~/.dinitctl
  ```

Either method makes `dinitctl` happy without touching backend code.

With these units in place your Void system boots directly to a login prompt on tty1; after you
authenticate, turnstile + dinit bring up niri and the rest in a strictly ordered, fully supervised
chain—no sleeps, no races, and nothing cluttering your `.profile`.
