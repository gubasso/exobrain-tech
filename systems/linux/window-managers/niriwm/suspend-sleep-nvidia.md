# Nvidia: suspend / sleep

Below is a concise guide to suspending (sleeping) your Arch Linux system under Niri WM, covering the
commands you’ll use, integrating them into your Niri config, handling NVIDIA hardware quirks, and
Polkit permissions.

## Key systemd commands for suspend, hibernate, and hybrid-sleep

- **Suspend to RAM** Run:

  ```bash
  systemctl suspend
  ```

  This enqueues the `suspend.target` unit and should just work out of the box on Arch Linux with
  systemd-logind running ([ArchWiki][1], [ArchWiki][1]).
- **Alternate invocation via loginctl** You can also call:

  ```bash
  loginctl suspend
  ```

  which triggers the same action through logind’s D-Bus interface
  ([Unix & Linux Stack Exchange][2]).
- **Hibernate to disk**

  ```bash
  systemctl hibernate
  ```

  (May require following the ArchWiki’s hibernation setup guide if it doesn’t work immediately.)
  ([ArchWiki][1])
- **Hybrid-sleep (suspend + hibernate)**

  ```bash
  systemctl hybrid-sleep
  ```

  Writes to both RAM and swap so you can recover after a power loss ([ArchWiki][1]).

## Binding a sleep key in your Niri WM config

Niri’s key bindings live in the `binds {}` section of your config (in KDL format). To bind the
XF86Sleep key to suspend:

```kdl
binds {
    XF86Sleep { spawn "systemctl" "suspend"; }
}
```

- The `spawn` action runs a binary without a shell, so you must separate arguments (binary first,
  then each argument) ([GitHub][3]).
- If you prefer a custom key combo, replace `XF86Sleep` with something like `Mod+Shift+S`
  ([GitHub][3]).
- Use a tool like `wev` to confirm the exact key name if needed ([GitHub][3]).

## NVIDIA Ada 3000-specific suspend tips

On systems with NVIDIA GPUs you may need the NVIDIA power services and init-rd hooks:

1. **Enable systemd services**

   ```bash
   systemctl enable nvidia-suspend.service \
                     nvidia-hibernate.service \
                     nvidia-resume.service
   ```

2. **Add hooks to `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`** Include `resume` and NVIDIA hooks in
   `HOOKS=(... resume nvidia ...)` and regenerate your initramfs.

Without these, `systemctl suspend` may black-screen but immediately wake ([Arch Linux Forums][4]).

## Polkit: allowing suspend without password

By default, active local sessions can suspend without extra auth, but if you face “authentication
required” prompts:

1. **Install Polkit**

   ```bash
   pacman -S polkit
   ```

2. **Create a rule** in `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-suspend.rules`:

   ```js
   polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
       if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.login1.suspend" &&
           subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
           return polkit.Result.YES;
       }
   });
   ```

   This grants wheel-group users passwordless suspend ([ArchWiki][5]).

---

With these steps, hitting your designated key in Niri will correctly invoke `systemctl suspend` (or
your chosen power command), even on NVIDIA-equipped hardware, and without unwanted password prompts.
