# Ship a Rust project — cookbook (TLDR)

One-file, top-to-bottom runbook to take a Rust crate from _repo + remote_ to _published,
branch-protected, CI-gated_. Copy-paste commands; each section footnotes the canonical spec that
owns the _why_.

> **Assumes:** a crate you can already `cargo build`, a git repo, and a GitHub remote (GitLab notes
> at the end). Replace `<owner>/<repo>` and `<crate>` throughout.
>
> **Cookbook:** steps + snippets only; the _why_ lives in the footnoted specs. Inlined snippets are a
> sanctioned exception to single-source-of-truth[^rule] — if one disagrees with its spec, **the spec wins**.

**See also:** general recipes — project-bootstrap[^gen-bootstrap], release-workflow[^gen-release];
Rust specs distilled here — project-bootstrap-spec[^rs-bootstrap],
release-workflow-spec[^rs-release], cli-spec[^cli]; platform enforcement — branch-protection[^bp].

---

## 0. Prerequisites

```bash
cargo --version         # rustc + cargo installed
gh auth status          # GitHub CLI authenticated  (https://cli.github.com)
jq --version            # used by the branch-protection setup script
git remote -v           # origin points at your GitHub repo
```

## 1. Scaffold the crate[^rs-bootstrap]

Skip if the crate already exists.

```bash
cargo new <crate>            # binary  -> src/main.rs
# cargo new --lib <crate>    # library -> src/lib.rs
# cargo init                 # in an existing directory
```

Pin the toolchain so bare `cargo`, CI, and editors never drift — `rust-toolchain.toml` at the repo
root:[^nix-toolchain]

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "stable"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
# targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"]
```

## 2. Crate metadata — the publish gate[^crate-meta]

crates.io **rejects** a publish without `description` and a license — set them now.[^crate-meta]

```toml
[package]
name = "<crate>"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
description = "One-sentence summary of what the crate does."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
repository = "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>"
readme = "README.md"
keywords = ["cli", "example", "tooling"]     # <=5, each <=20 chars
categories = ["command-line-utilities"]      # must match canonical slugs exactly
rust-version = "1.74"                         # MSRV

# Keep the .crate tarball lean (denylist; leading / anchors to package root).
exclude = [
    "/docs", "/.github", "/scripts",
    "/deny.toml", "/release-plz.toml", "/dist-workspace.toml",
    "/justfile", "/flake.nix", "/flake.lock", "/.pre-commit-config.yaml",
]
```

Ship the license files too (`LICENSE-MIT` + `LICENSE-APACHE`) — the SPDX field doesn't include them.[^crate-meta]

## 3. Quality gates[^rs-gates]

Lints in `Cargo.toml`:[^cli-quality]

```toml
[lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "forbid"          # drop if you genuinely need unsafe

[lints.clippy]
pedantic         = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
nursery          = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
unwrap_used      = "warn"
expect_used      = "warn"
# restriction — catch scaffolding left behind
todo             = "deny"
dbg_macro        = "deny"
unimplemented    = "deny"
panic            = "deny"
wildcard_imports = "deny"
```

Dependency + license policy — `deny.toml` at the crate root:[^cli-quality]

```toml
[graph]
targets = []
all-features = true

[advisories]
vulnerability = "deny"
unmaintained = "warn"
unsound = "warn"
yanked = "warn"

[licenses]
allow = [
    "MIT",
    "Apache-2.0",
    "Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception",
    "BSD-2-Clause",
    "BSD-3-Clause",
    "ISC",
    "Zlib",
    "Unicode-3.0",
    "Unicode-DFS-2016",
]

[bans]
multiple-versions = "warn"
deny = [
    { name = "openssl-sys" },  # prefer rustls for static builds
]

[sources]
unknown-registry = "deny"
unknown-git = "deny"
```

Run the gates locally:[^rs-gates]

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run
cargo deny check
```

Pre-commit hooks — `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, then `pre-commit install`:[^gen-gates]

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: cargo-fmt
        name: cargo fmt --check
        entry: cargo fmt --check
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        pass_filenames: false
      - id: cargo-clippy
        name: cargo clippy
        entry: cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
        language: system
        types: [rust]
        pass_filenames: false
```

One command surface — `justfile`:[^gen-gates]

```just
default:
    @just --list

fmt:
    cargo fmt

lint:
    cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

test:
    cargo nextest run

check: fmt lint test
    cargo deny check
```

## 4. Local dev shell (Nix)[^nix-devshell]

A flake that reads `rust-toolchain.toml`, so local + CI share one toolchain and can't drift.
`flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  description = "rust dev shell (toolchain from rust-toolchain.toml)";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    rust-overlay.url = "github:oxalica/rust-overlay";
    rust-overlay.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs =
    { self, nixpkgs, rust-overlay, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (
      system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system;
          overlays = [ (import rust-overlay) ];
        };
        toolchain = pkgs.rust-bin.fromRustupToolchainFile ./rust-toolchain.toml;
      in
      {
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          packages = [
            toolchain
            pkgs.cargo-nextest
            pkgs.cargo-deny
            pkgs.cargo-audit
            pkgs.just
            pkgs.pre-commit
          ];
          shellHook = ''echo "rust dev shell ready (toolchain from rust-toolchain.toml)"'';
        };
      }
    );
}
```

`.envrc` (direnv auto-loads on `cd`), then lock + enter:

```bash
echo 'use flake' > .envrc
nix flake lock            # generate flake.lock — commit it
direnv allow              # or a one-off: nix develop
```

## 5. First CI workflow[^gen-ci]

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` reuses the flake and runs the gates on every push/PR. The **job name is
the status-check context** branch protection will require (§6) — name it deliberately.

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  push:
    branches: [develop, master]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main
      - run: |
          nix develop -c bash -c '
            cargo fmt --check &&
            cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings &&
            cargo nextest run --profile ci &&
            cargo deny check
          '
```

Optional CI test profile — `.config/nextest.toml` (a non-default profile is inert unless invoked
with `--profile ci`):[^cli-test]

```toml
[profile.ci]
fail-fast = false
retries = { backoff = "exponential", count = 2, delay = "1s", max-delay = "10s", jitter = true }
status-level = "fail"
final-status-level = "fail"
success-output = "never"
failure-output = "immediate-final"
```

## 6. Branch security[^bp]

Model: `develop` integrates (feature branches PR here); `master` mirrors releases (CI-only, linear
history); `v*` tags immutable.[^bp-model]

1. **Create `develop`** (if it doesn't exist yet) and push it:

   ```bash
   git switch -c develop && git push -u origin develop
   ```

2. **Apply all three rulesets + set the default branch** with one script[^bp] (`REQUIRED_CHECKS` must
   match the CI job name from §5, `"test"`):

   ```bash
   OWNER_REPO=<owner>/<repo> REQUIRED_CHECKS="test" \
     "$DOCS_NOTES_REPO"/tech/tools/git/branch-protection/github/setup.sh
   ```

   Applies: `master` — no human writes, linear history, CI bypass actor, 1 review; `develop` — 1
   review, no force-push/deletion; `v*` tags — no delete/update. _(Solo project? Set the review count
   to `0` — see [^bp].)_

3. **Enable Actions write** (the script can't via the API):[^bp-firstrun] **Settings → Actions →
   General →** allow Actions; **Workflow permissions → Read and write**; tick **Allow GitHub Actions to
   create and approve pull requests**.

4. **Add the promote workflow** — copy `release-promote.yml` into `.github/workflows/` so CI
   fast-forwards `master` onto each release tag.[^promote]

## 7. Release + publish[^rs-release]

Once per project, in order:[^rs-runbook]

1. **Validate metadata (no token):**

   ```bash
   cargo publish --dry-run
   cargo package --list
   ```

2. **First publish is manual** — Trusted Publishing attaches to a crate that already exists.[^oidc]
   Create a scoped token[^tokens] at <https://crates.io/settings/tokens> (endpoint `publish-new`,
   exact crate scope, shortest expiry), then:

   ```bash
   cargo login          # paste the token
   cargo publish
   ```

3. **Register the trusted publisher** at `https://crates.io/crates/<crate>/settings` → Trusted
   Publishing → Add:[^oidc]
   - Repository: `<owner>/<repo>`
   - **Workflow filename: `release-plz.yml`** — the **publish** workflow, never the CI
     (`ci.yml`) or the binary (`release.yml`) workflow.
   - Environment: blank — only needed if the release-plz job declares an `environment:`.

4. **Revoke the bootstrap token** at <https://crates.io/settings/tokens>. CI mints short-lived OIDC
   tokens from here on.[^tokens]

5. **Commit release automation.** `release-plz.toml`:[^rs-plz]

   ```toml
   # See https://release-plz.dev/docs/config for all options.
   [workspace]
   changelog_update = true   # maintain CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits
   release_always   = false  # release only when there is something to release
   publish          = true   # publish to crates.io on release-PR merge
   semver_check     = true   # gate public-API compatibility (libraries)
   ```

   `release_always = false` gates **publish**, not the release PR.[^rs-plz]

   `.github/workflows/release-plz.yml` — runs on `develop`, OIDC auth (**no
   `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`**), under a GitHub App token so its tag push retriggers cargo-dist
   (§8):[^rs-plz]

   ```yaml
   name: release-plz

   on:
     push:
       branches: [develop]

   permissions:
     contents: write
     pull-requests: write
     id-token: write

   jobs:
     release-plz:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 0
         - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v3
           id: app-token
           with:
             app-id: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PLZ_APP_ID }}
             private-key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PLZ_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
         - uses: release-plz/action@v0.5
           id: release-plz
           with:
             command: release-plz
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
   ```

   **GitHub App token (enables automatic binaries).** Runs release-plz so its tag push retriggers
   cargo-dist's `release.yml` (§8) — the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not.[^app-token] The App is
   account-wide and workflow-agnostic — register it **once** and reuse it across every repo (steps 2–3
   repeat per repo):

   1. **Register the App** (once per account) — Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → **New**.
      Fill only these; leave everything else at its default:
      - **Name** — unique, ≤34 chars; prefer a neutral, reusable name like `<owner>-ci-bot` (not
        `<owner>-release-plz-bot`).
      - **Homepage URL** — your profile `https://github.com/<owner>` (required but cosmetic).
      - **Webhook → Active** — **uncheck**.
      - **Repository permissions** — **Contents: Read and write** and **Pull requests: Read and write**.
      - **Where can this be installed?** — **Only on this account**.

      Then click **Create GitHub App**.
   2. **Generate a private key** (once) — on the App's page → **Private keys** → **Generate a private
      key**. A `.pem` downloads; store it securely (GitHub keeps only the public half).
   3. **Install the App** on the repo (per repo) — on the App's page → **Install App** (left sidebar) →
      **Install** next to your account → choose **Only select repositories** → select `<owner>/<repo>` →
      **Install**. Creation alone mints no token — an uninstalled App is inert.
   4. **Store two repo secrets** (per repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **New
      repository secret**) — same values in every repo:
      - `RELEASE_PLZ_APP_ID` — the App's numeric ID (shown under **About** on the App page).
      - `RELEASE_PLZ_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` — the full contents of the downloaded `.pem`.

   (`promote` pushes `master` with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` — keep `github-actions[bot]` in §6's bypass list.)

   **(Optional `develop`/`master` topology.)** Add a `promote` `needs:` job to fast-forward `master`
   onto each release tag — don't re-create the tag; protected `master` needs the App token / bypass
   actor.[^branch-model]

6. **(Optional) Enable "require trusted publishing"** on the crate once an OIDC release has
   succeeded — it rejects all token publishes.[^oidc]

**The everyday loop after setup:** merge a `feat:`/`fix:` to `develop` → release-plz opens a release
PR → merge it → release-plz tags `vX.Y.Z` and publishes over OIDC.[^branch-model]

## 8. (Optional) Prebuilt binaries — cargo-dist[^cargo-dist]

```bash
cargo install cargo-dist
dist init          # writes dist-workspace.toml + .github/workflows/release.yml
dist generate      # regenerate release.yml after editing dist-workspace.toml
```

`release.yml` (binaries) is a **separate** file from `release-plz.yml` — never merge or register it
with the trusted publisher. It is **tag-triggered**, firing on the tag release-plz pushes with §7's
App token.[^cargo-dist] Then `cargo binstall <crate>` works for free.

## 9. Day-2 — semver / yank / rollback[^semver]

```bash
cargo semver-checks check-release      # libraries: catch API breaks (release-plz runs this)
cargo yank --version 1.2.3             # stop new selections of a bad version
cargo yank --version 1.2.3 --undo      # reverse it
```

Published versions are **immutable** — rollback = fix forward (patch on `develop`, cut a new PATCH),
optionally yank.[^semver]

## GitLab notes

Branch model, release-plz/OIDC, and metadata are identical. Differences:

- **Branch protection:**
  `PROJECT=group/project TIER=free "$DOCS_NOTES_REPO"/tech/tools/git/branch-protection/gitlab/setup.sh`
  (or `TIER=premium BOT_USER_ID=<id>`).[^bp]
- **Enable CI/CD**, let the pipeline write to `master`, set default branch `develop`.[^bp-firstrun]
- **OIDC:** crates.io Trusted Publishing supports gitlab.com (not self-hosted). The job requests a
  GitLab `id_token`, exchanges it via `CRATES_IO_ID_TOKEN`, then `cargo publish`; register the
  publisher for GitLab (project path + CI config filename).[^oidc]
