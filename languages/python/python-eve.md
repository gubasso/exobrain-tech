You may use flask’s abort() to interrupt the database operation:

```
from flask import abort

def check_update_access(resource, updates, original):

    abort(403)

app = Eve()

app.on_insert_item += check_update_access
```

## steps to setup server

> last section of tutorial: sumup of steps to setup server and run in production, use real script
> and code

- python organize files and directories

- gunicorn docs and options, check maia's course

- install python (use asdf, latest version)

- set poetry [^flask_intro]

- install pdm `eve` [^eve]

- install `gunicorn`

  - exposed through nginx
  - force to be used just to a user?

- install mongodb

  - arch wiki / official docs
  - separated config file to run
  - just localhost: `bindIp: 127.0.0.1`
  - only python gunicorn is exposed through nginx
  - use ufw firewall to ensure security steps
    - ufw default deny incoming
    - ufw default allow outgoing
    - ufw allow ssh... etc...
    - ufw enable [^why_mongo]

- rate limit: let it to nginx, Cade's TI will handle it

- cache optimization

  - python-eve docs

- setup python service (gunicorn?)
