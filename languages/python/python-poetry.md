# Python Poetry

> **Environment vs dependencies.** Poetry is the **dependency/packaging** manager (deps, lockfile,
> scripts) — it is not the environment manager. The Python runtime and the Poetry binary come from
> the project's **Nix flake devShell**; run Poetry _inside_ it (`nix develop` → `poetry install`).
> Do not replace Poetry with Nix / poetry2nix by default. See
> [development-tools-workflow](../../workflows/development-tools-workflow.md) and
> [nix](../../tools/nix/README.md). The `pip install poetry` / `RUN pip install ...` lines below are
> container/deployment patterns, not local-dev setup.

- Poetry alternative (written in Rust): https://github.com/astral-sh/rye

To add a local module

```sh
poetry add --editable ../my-module-dir
```

Generates:

```toml
my-module-dir = {path = "../my-module-dir", develop = true}
```

```pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
my-script = "my_module:main"
```

`poetry run my-script`

`poetry export --output requirements.txt`

`poetry export --output requirements.txt --without-hashes`

- `PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`: pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt

To deploy in production with Docker (example):[^6]

```entrypoint.sh
python main.py
or
python myapp
```

About `__main__.py` as entrypoint: https://docs.python.org/3/library/**main**.html

## Deploy Example 1: `requirements.txt`

- Generate `requirements.txt` with a shell script, and build image[^7][^9]:

```build.sh
poetry export -o requirements.txt
docker build .
```

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster
PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
RUN pip install /tmp/myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]
```

## Deploy Example 2: Poetry inside container[^7]

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster
PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install poetry
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry install --no-root --no-dev
COPY . .
RUN poetry install --no-dev
ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoint.sh"]
```

## General

### reset a poetry virtual env

To reset a Poetry virtual environment, you can follow these steps to effectively remove the current
virtual environment and recreate it. This can be useful if your environment becomes corrupted or you
want to start fresh.

#### Steps to Reset a Poetry Virtual Environment

1. **Remove the Existing Virtual Environment** : Use the following command to remove the current
   virtual environment:

```bash
poetry env remove <python-version>
```

To get the specific `<python-version>`, you can use:

```bash
poetry env info --path
```

For example, if you’re using Python 3.9, you could run:

```bash
poetry env remove 3.9
```

If you want to remove all virtual environments for the project, you can use:

```bash
poetry env remove --all
```

1. **Recreate the Virtual Environment** : After removing the old virtual environment, you can
   recreate a new environment with:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in your `pyproject.toml` file into a new virtual
environment.

1. **Check the Status** : You can verify the status of your new virtual environment by running:

```bash
poetry env info
```

This should successfully reset the virtual environment for your Poetry-managed project.

maybe remove `poetry.lock`
