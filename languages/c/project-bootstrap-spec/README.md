# C — bootstrap a new project (spec/binding)

The C binding of
[`tech/programming/project-bootstrap/`](../../../programming/project-bootstrap/README.md). It
applies the general once-per-project recipe with concrete C tooling — source/include layout, a build
system (CMake or Meson), compiler and C-standard choice, and the clang-format / clang-tidy /
cppcheck / sanitizer quality gates — and links to C implementation-kinds.

This binding **overlays** the general spine; it does not restate it. Read the general recipe first,
then the C specifics here.

## How to use this binding

1. Read the general [hub](../../../programming/project-bootstrap/README.md) and
   [general runbook](../../../programming/project-bootstrap/runbook.md) — the cross-language _what_.
2. Follow this [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md) for the C-specific overlay steps.
3. Jump to your implementation-kind file (e.g. [`cli-project.md`](./cli-project.md) or
   [`library-project.md`](./library-project.md)).

## Implementation kinds

- [`cli-project.md`](./cli-project.md) — C CLI: the bootstrap-time ordering for argument parsing,
  entry point, and exit codes.
- [`library-project.md`](./library-project.md) — C library: a shared/static library with a public
  header API, install/export rules, and ABI hygiene.

`daemon-project.md` and other kinds are followups; add them when you bootstrap those kinds.
