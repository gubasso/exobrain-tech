# CSS — bootstrap a new project (spec/binding)

The CSS binding of
[`tech/programming/project-bootstrap/`](../../../programming/project-bootstrap/README.md). It
applies the general once-per-project recipe with concrete front-end tooling — stylesheet
architecture and naming, a PostCSS/Sass pipeline, the npm/pnpm package manager hosted in a Nix
devShell, and the stylelint/prettier quality gates — and links to CSS implementation-kinds.

This binding **overlays** the general spine; it does not restate it. Read the general recipe first,
then the CSS specifics here.

## How to use this binding

1. Read the general [hub](../../../programming/project-bootstrap/README.md) and
   [general runbook](../../../programming/project-bootstrap/runbook.md) — the cross-language _what_.
2. Follow this [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md) for the CSS-specific overlay steps.
3. Jump to your implementation-kind file (e.g. [`stylesheet-library.md`](./stylesheet-library.md)).

## Implementation kinds

- [`stylesheet-library.md`](./stylesheet-library.md) — a reusable stylesheet / design-system /
  component-library package: design tokens, theming, and npm distribution.

`app-embedded-stylesheet.md` (stylesheets bundled into an app rather than published) is a followup;
add it when you bootstrap that kind.
