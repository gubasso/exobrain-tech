# 03 — Tooling by ecosystem

The [release-PR invariant](./01-release-automation.md) is implemented by a different tool in each
ecosystem. Pick the idiomatic one; they all reduce to "merge the release PR to publish."

Each language binding under `tech/languages/*/release-workflow-spec/` documents the concrete tool +
workflow YAML.

Binary/artifact distribution — shipping **prebuilt binaries and installers** — is a concern separate
from registry publishing (which ships source). A crate can do either, both, or neither. When you run
both, keep them in **separate workflow files** and register only the _publish_ file with the
registry's trusted publisher — see
[04 — Workflow file conventions](./04-workflow-file-conventions.md).

## How each tool implements the model

- **release-plz** — watches `develop`, opens a release PR (version bump via Conventional Commits +
  changelog via git-cliff, `cargo-semver-checks` for libraries); on merge it tags every package and
  runs `cargo publish`. The most complete Rust option. See the
  [rust binding](../../languages/rust/release-workflow-spec/).
- **release-please** — Google's **language-agnostic** release-PR bot (23+ release types: Node,
  Python, Rust, Go, Java…). Maintains a release PR, tags on merge, creates a GitHub Release. **Key
  divergence:** it stops at the tag/Release and does **not** publish to a registry — you bolt on an
  ecosystem publish step (gated on its `autorelease: tagged`/`published` label). Attractive as a
  single uniform PR/tag layer across a polyglot repo.
- **Changesets** — the JS/monorepo standard. Developers add **changeset files** per PR stating the
  bump + summary; `changesets/action` opens a **"Version Packages"** PR; on merge it versions and
  publishes. Uses explicit intent files instead of Conventional Commits.
- **python-semantic-release** — full-lifecycle but **push-model** (publishes on push to the default
  branch, no release-PR gate). Use release-please instead when you want the merge gate.
- **GoReleaser** — Go has no central registry; the "release" is a git **tag** plus cross-compiled
  artifacts on the GitHub/GitLab Release and the module proxy. Tagging is publishing. This is the
  intentional exception to the registry-publish leg of the model.

## The promotion step (official pattern)

Whichever tool cuts the release, **promote `master` onto the release tag**, not onto a branch tip or
a workflow trigger SHA — the tag is the canonical marker of what was published
([00 — Branch model](./00-branch-model.md)).

Two wirings, depending on who creates the tag:

- **Bot creates the tag (release-plz, release-please).** On GitHub, a tag pushed with the default
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** retrigger workflows, so a standalone `on: push: tags` promote job
  never fires. Run promotion as a **`needs:` job in the same release run**, reading the release
  tool's output to learn the tag, then fast-forward `master` to it. The
  [rust binding](../../languages/rust/release-workflow-spec/) shows this end to end.
- **A human pushes the tag (manual-tag model).** A human's tag push _does_ retrigger, so a separate
  `on: push: tags: ['v*']` **release-promote** workflow is the clean split. See the templates in
  [branch-protection/](../../tools/git/branch-protection/).

Either way the promote job: resolve the tag → verify its commit is an ancestor of `develop` →
`git merge --ff-only` `master` onto the tag → push.
