## Trees and Graphs

- DFS: easier with recursive functions
- BFS: easier with iterative functions

Both can be used because both runs throw the entire tree.

BFS vs DFS, such as their **drawbacks**

"The main disadvantage of DFS is that you could end up wasting a lot of time looking for a value.
Let's say that you had a huge tree, and you were looking for a value that is stored in the root's
right child. If you do DFS prioritizing left before right, then you will search the entire left
subtree, which could be hundreds of thousands if not millions of operations. Meanwhile, the node is
literally one operation away from the root. The main disadvantage of BFS is that if the node you're
searching for is near the bottom, then you will waste a lot of time searching through all the levels
to reach the bottom."

"In terms of space complexity, if you have a complete binary tree, then the amount of space used by
the recursive call stack for DFS is linear with the height, which is logarithmic with n (the number
of nodes). The amount of space used by the queue is linear with n, so DFS has a much better space
complexity. The reason the queue will grow linearly is because the final level in a complete binary
tree can have up to n/2 nodes.

However, if you have a lopsided tree (like a straight line), then BFS will have an O(1)O(1) space
complexity while DFS will have O(n)O(n) (although, a lopsided tree is an edge case whereas a full
tree is the expectation)."

# Recursive Functions

[How to write Recursive Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggk7HbcnLG8)

**Basic Structure**

```
func()
{
  if(  )
  {
    // base case (2)
  }
  else
  {
    // recursive procedure (1)
  }
}
```

(1) First write recursive procedure (2) Then write the base case

Step 1) Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems

```
Calculate the factorial(4)

Fact(1) = 1;
Fact(2) = 2 * 1 = 2 * Fact(1);
Fact(3) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 3 * Fact(2);
Fact(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4 * Fact(3);
```

- Begin with the simplest cases

```
Fact(n) = n * Fact(n-1)
```

```
Fact(int n)
{
  if(  )
  {
    // base case (2)
  }
  else
  {
    return n * Fact(n-1);
  }
}
```

Step 2) Specify the base condition to stop the recursion

```
Fact(1) = 1
```

```
Fact(int n)
{
  if( n == 1 )
  {
    return 1;
  }
  else
  {
    return n * Fact(n-1);
  }
}
```

"In this type of questions (where question want some minimum/ maximum / at least ) we use concept of
Binary search"[^1]

[5.1 Graph Traversals - BFS & DFS -Breadth First Search and Depth First Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKY4hjDrxk)

- objective: find the shortest path on unweighted graphs

- time complexity: O(v+e) (vertices + edges)

explores nodes in layer:

- start node: explore neighbours (1 layer)

- neighbours (1): explores their neighbours (2)

- neighbours (2): ...

- can be used to convert/transform a tree/graph to an array/vector
