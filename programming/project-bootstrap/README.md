# Project Bootstrap — General Recipe

Language-agnostic principles and the ordered, once-per-project setup that every new repository needs
_before_ feature work begins: create the repo, lay the foundations (ignore/license/readme), seed
governance docs, wire the local dev environment and quality gates, stand up CI and branch
protection, and set a security baseline. Use this tree as the source of truth for _what_ a new
project must have, and the language-specific `project-bootstrap-spec/` bindings for the concrete
tooling.

Bootstrap is deliberately the **earliest** phase — repo → foundations → gates — and is distinct from
and precedes the later [release workflow](../release-workflow/README.md) phase. As with releases,
the durable value here is the ordered checklist and the one-owner-per-fact discipline, not any
single command; automation ([cog](https://github.com/gubasso/cog)) accelerates the _how_ but this
tree owns the _what_.

## The three-layer model

A new project is set up by descending three layers, each owning a disjoint set of facts:

```text
General            tech/programming/project-bootstrap/          # any project, any language
   │                 repo, license, gitignore, governance,
   │                 dev env, quality gates, CI, security
   ▼
Language           tech/languages/<lang>/project-bootstrap-spec/ # ecosystem choices
   │                 e.g. Rust: cargo layout, toolchain, clippy/deny
   ▼
Implementation     …/project-bootstrap-spec/<kind>.md            # shape-specific additions
                     e.g. rust CLI: arg-parsing, logging, config
```

Ownership:

- **General** owns universal, cross-language steps. This is the spine.
- **Language** owns ecosystem choices; it _overlays_ the general spine and never restates it.
- **Implementation-kind** owns shape-specific additions (CLI, library, service); it delegates the
  detailed _how_ to any existing spec and owns only the bootstrap-time ordering.

Routing flow the user follows:

```text
root README  →  this hub  →  runbook.md  →  language project-bootstrap-spec/README.md
                                          →  language runbook.md  →  <kind>.md
```

## How to use this tree

1. Read [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md) first — the ordered, once-per-project spine of _what_ to do and
   _in what order_. Every other page explains the _why_ behind one of its steps.
2. Read the chapter behind any step you need to understand (the [Index](#index) below).
3. Jump to your language binding (e.g.
   [Rust](../../languages/rust/project-bootstrap-spec/README.md)) for the ecosystem specifics, then
   to your implementation-kind file.
4. When the project is scaffolded and gated, move on to the
   [release workflow](../release-workflow/README.md) — the phase that follows bootstrap.

## Language-specific bindings

These bindings apply the general recipe with a concrete toolchain. They assume you've read the
general runbook, and each links back to it. Every language stack has one; they all follow the same
shape (README + runbook + `00-toolchain-and-layout` + `01-quality-gates` + implementation-kind
files):

- [`rust`](../../languages/rust/project-bootstrap-spec/) — the **reference binding**: cargo layout +
  toolchain pinning, rustfmt/clippy/deny gates, CLI implementation-kind.
- [`bash`](../../languages/bash/project-bootstrap-spec/) — shfmt/shellcheck/bats,
  `set -euo pipefail`, getopts CLI.
- [`c`](../../languages/c/project-bootstrap-spec/) — CMake/Meson, clang-format/clang-tidy,
  sanitizers; CLI + library kinds.
- [`css`](../../languages/css/project-bootstrap-spec/) — stylelint/prettier, PostCSS/Sass;
  stylesheet-library kind.
- [`go`](../../languages/go/project-bootstrap-spec/) — go mod, golangci-lint, govulncheck; CLI +
  web-service kinds.
- [`javascript`](../../languages/javascript/project-bootstrap-spec/) — npm/pnpm, prettier/eslint,
  vitest, tsc; CLI + web-app kinds.
- [`lua`](../../languages/lua/project-bootstrap-spec/) — LuaRocks, stylua/luacheck/busted;
  rock-library kind.
- [`nix`](../../languages/nix/project-bootstrap-spec/) — flake init, `nix flake check`,
  statix/deadnix; flake-project kind.
- [`python`](../../languages/python/project-bootstrap-spec/) — uv, ruff, mypy, pytest; CLI + library
  kinds.
- [`r`](../../languages/r/project-bootstrap-spec/) — usethis/renv, lintr/testthat; package +
  analysis kinds.
- [`zig`](../../languages/zig/project-bootstrap-spec/) — zig init, build.zig.zon, zig fmt/test;
  CLI + library kinds.

Add further implementation-kinds (library, web-service, …) under a language binding as followups
when you bootstrap a project of that kind.

## Related (later phases & platform setup)

- [Release workflow](../release-workflow/README.md) — the **next** phase, once the project is
  scaffolded and gated.
- [Branch protection & CI-driven release](../../tools/git/branch-protection/) — the platform
  runbooks and rulesets the bootstrap runbook invokes (linked, never copied here).
- [Single source of truth](../docs-design/04-single-source-of-truth.md) and
  [Diátaxis zones](../docs-design/01-diataxis-zones.md) — the docs-design standards this shelf
  obeys: one owner per fact, runbooks are how-to guides.

## TL;DR (the irreducible defaults)

- **One owner per fact.** Each step lives in exactly one place; other layers link, never restate.
- **The runbook is the spine.** [`runbook.md`](./runbook.md) is the ordered _what_; chapters are the
  _why_; language and kind bindings are _overlays_.
- **Tool docs are linked, not copied.** Branch protection and release setup keep their own homes.
- **cog automates _how_; this tree owns _what_.** If they disagree, fix the runbook first, then cog.
- **Bootstrap precedes release.** Get the project scaffolded and gated here; publish over in
  [release-workflow](../release-workflow/README.md).
