## Basics[^1]

`^` and `$` are called "anchors". They anchor the match to the beginning and end of the string
respectively.

```
^foo    matches any string starting with 'foo'
foo$    matches any string ending with 'foo'
^foo$   matches exact string 'foo'.
```

To be precise, the last one is "any string starting and ending with the same 'foo'"; "foofoo" does
not match.

`[0-9]` is an example of a character class; it matches any single digit. `[a-z]` matches any lower
case alpha, and `[0-9a-f]` is the range of hex characters.

`.` (the period) is special -- it matches any character. If you want to match an actual period, you
need to say `\.`.

`*`, `?`, and `+` are quantifiers. They apply to the previous token. `a*` means "zero or more 'a'
characters". Similarly `a+` means "one or more", and `a?` means "zero or one".

As a result, `.*` means "any number (including zero) of any character".

The previous token need not be a single character; you can use parens to make it longer. `(foo)+`
matches one or more "foo", (like "foo", "foofoo", "foofoofoo", etc.)
