# 00 — Architecture

The shape every CLI should default to. Define the directory roles, split parse-shape from
runtime-shape, build one `AppContext` and pass it by reference, and stay single-crate until you have
a concrete reason not to.

## Vocabulary

The other chapters use these terms. Read them here once.

| Term              | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **parse-shape**   | The argument struct the CLI parser produces. Strings, `Option<String>`, booleans. Constrained by what's ergonomic on the command line.        |
| **runtime-shape** | The domain struct the handler uses after parsing. Newtypes, parsed enums, validated paths. Cannot represent invalid states.                   |
| **AppContext**    | The single value built once in `main` and threaded by reference. Holds resolved config, paths, runtime handle, UI, and the root tracing span. |
| **command**       | A subcommand handler — one `run(&AppContext, <Verb>Args) -> Result<(), AppError>` per subcommand.                                             |
| **service**       | Use-case orchestration shared by ≥2 commands. Optional.                                                                                       |
| **adapter**       | The only place that talks to the outside world. One per external system.                                                                      |
| **domain**        | Pure types + invariants. No I/O.                                                                                                              |

## Facing category & message types

Choose a CLI's facing category at design time, before implementation starts. This is not a runtime
`isatty()` switch: terminal detection can tune a human-UX renderer, but it must not change the
tool's public contract.

### Facing categories

| Category           | Primary consumer                           | Default output     | Always present | Optional surface                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **human-facing**   | A human at a terminal                      | **human-UX**       | log-messages   | machine-output via CLI options such as `--json`          |
| **machine-facing** | A coding agent, script, or another program | **machine-output** | log-messages   | human-UX only when explicitly required; never by default |

There is no separate "dual" category. A human-facing tool already ships machine-output options, so
it covers the dual case without weakening the default UX.

### Message types

1. **human-UX** — for humans only. Keep messages nice, lean, clean, colorful, ergonomic, explicit,
   and self-explanatory. Use examples, layouts, tables, schemes, ASCII art, spinners, async waiters,
   and the best terminal-UX helper for the language when they improve comprehension. Choose the best
   human format per output. Ship bash completion and man pages, including access through a
   subcommand.
2. **machine-output** — for agents and programs. Emit JSON or the best machine-readable format for
   that output. Do not paginate by default; if output can become too large, document the
   limit/page/cursor/offset rules in `--help` so an agent can request pages itself. Be
   token-friendly when possible without compromising machine readability. Ship self-documented
   surfaces agents can learn from: `help`/usage, `doctor` for checks and diagnostics, `init` for
   setup/scaffold/bootstrap that reuses `doctor` checks as the source of truth, bash completion, and
   man pages, including access through a subcommand.
3. **log-messages** — for both categories, always. Log to files by default and mirror to `stderr`
   only as an explicit opt-in (e.g. `--log-stderr`); never to `stdout`, which stays reserved for the
   human result or machine-output (see the channels matrix in
   [01 — Logging & Output](./01-logging-and-output.md)). Use XDG-compliant paths, defaulting to user
   XDG paths under `$HOME`. Provide at least `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug` levels, with room
   to extend. Coding agents are expected log consumers too.

### Category mapping

| Facing category    | human-UX                            | machine-output                       | log-messages |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **human-facing**   | Default                             | Available via CLI options (`--json`) | Always       |
| **machine-facing** | Only if explicitly required; opt-in | Default                              | Always       |

## Directory roles

```text

├─ main.rs                 entry: parse → init logging → AppContext → dispatch → exit-code

├─ fixtures/
├─ snapshots/

```

Every directory has a **single responsibility** and an explicit **"does NOT belong here"** rule. If
a file violates that rule, move the file or fix the rule — don't let it rot. The language-specific
specs (`tech/languages/<lang>/cli-spec/00-directory-tree.md`) translate this skeleton to concrete
file names and module syntax.

This tree maps onto **clean-architecture / hexagonal** layers — useful when discussing the design
with people who think in those terms:

- **Domain** → `domain/`
- **Application** → `commands/` + `services/`
- **Infrastructure** → `adapters/` + `config/` + `context.rs`
- **Presentation** → `cli/` + `ui/` for human-facing tools, or `cli/` + a structured-output boundary
  for machine-facing tools

The directory names stay as above; the layer names are just vocabulary.

### `main`

**Owns**: parse args, init logging, build `AppContext`, dispatch to a command, map errors to exit
codes.

**Does NOT own**: business logic, I/O, parser definitions, runtime construction beyond the one
instance handed to `AppContext`.

**Size**: keep it ≤ 120 LOC. When it grows, lift code into `cli/`, `commands/`, or `logging.rs`.

### `cli/`

**Owns**: CLI parser definitions — the parse-shape of every flag, arg, and subcommand.

**Does NOT own**: business logic, I/O, error mapping beyond what the parser requires.

**Rule**: one file per subcommand. The root file (mod entry) exposes the top-level parser, the
subcommand enum, and any shared global args.

### `commands/`

**Owns**: handlers. Each file exposes a free function
`run(&AppContext, <Verb>Args) -> Result<(), AppError>` that projects parse-shape into runtime-shape,
calls services / adapters, renders output, and returns a typed error.

**Does NOT own**: parser definitions (those are in `cli/`), direct I/O (delegate to `adapters/`),
orchestration shared across commands (lift into `services/`).

### `domain/`

**Owns**: pure types and invariants. Newtypes for IDs, paths, names; algebraic types for state
machines. Constructors enforce invariants via `TryFrom` / `from_str`.

**Does NOT own**: any I/O. A `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` on a domain struct is fine; calling
a file/JSON reader is not — that goes to `adapters/`.

### `services/` (optional)

**Owns**: use-case orchestration shared by ≥2 commands, or non-trivial pure cores you want to
unit-test in isolation.

**Does NOT own**: anything used by only one command (inline it), direct I/O (call adapters), domain
invariants (those live in `domain/`).

**Heuristic**: if you'd duplicate the logic across two `commands/*.rs` files, extract a service.
Otherwise, don't pre-extract.

### `adapters/`

**Owns**: every conversation with the outside world. One file per external system (`fs`, `git`,
`http`, `process`, `clock`, …). Each defines a trait + a default implementation.

**Does NOT own**: domain logic, command orchestration, terminal output.

**Errors**: each adapter defines its own error type (e.g. `GitError`, `HttpError`). The top-level
`AppError` aggregates them at the boundary. Mechanism is language-specific (Rust: `#[from]`; Python:
exception hierarchy; Bash: namespaced exit codes) — see
[02 — Error Messages](./02-error-messages.md).

### `config/`

**Owns**: layered config loading. Defines the resolved `Config` struct and the merge chain. See
[03 — Config Precedence](./03-config-precedence.md).

**Does NOT own**: global mutable state, business invariants (those live in `domain/`).

### `context.rs`

**Owns**: the `AppContext` struct, built once in `main` and passed by reference everywhere. Holds
`Config`, paths, the human-facing UI handle or machine-facing structured-output/protocol facility,
the async-runtime handle (if any), the tracing root span, and an interface to clocks/randomness.

**Does NOT own**: methods that do real work. `AppContext` is a value object, not a god-class.
Behavior goes to `commands/`, `services/`, or `adapters/`.

**`Paths`**: resolves the three XDG directories once, kept distinct so the wrong byte never lands in
the wrong place:

- `config_home` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) — user-editable settings, loaded by `config/`.
- `state_home` (`$XDG_STATE_HOME`) — app-written persistent state (logs, sessions, history).
  Accessed via `adapters/`.
- `cache_home` (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME`) — ephemeral, safe to delete. Accessed via `adapters/`.

Resolve once here, never recompute. Language-specific defaults live in each `cli-spec/`.

### `error.rs`

**Owns**: the top-level `AppError` enum and its `exit_code()` mapping. See
[02 — Error Messages](./02-error-messages.md).

### `logging.rs`

**Owns**: the install helper for the logging subsystem. See
[01 — Logging & Output](./01-logging-and-output.md).

**Does NOT own**: log emission. Only the install.

### `ui/`

**Owns**: every byte of human-facing output. Renderers, color, progress bars, prompts. Human-facing
tools use this as their presentation boundary.

**Does NOT own**: machine-output or structured diagnostics. Machine-facing tools use an `output/` or
`protocol/` boundary for their default output, and log-messages go through the logging layer.

**Rule**: for human-facing tools, no print statement is allowed _anywhere else_ in the codebase.
Treat it as a CI lint. For machine-facing tools, apply the same centralization rule to the
structured-output boundary.

### `util/`

**Owns**: truly generic helpers, ≤ 200 LOC per file.

**Does NOT own**: anything that mentions a domain noun. If it does, it belongs in `domain/` or
`services/`.

### `tests/`

**Owns**: process-level integration tests. One file per subcommand. Shared helpers under `support/`.
Snapshots under `snapshots/`.

**Does NOT own**: pure unit tests — those colocate inside each module.

## Parse-shape vs runtime-shape

The argument struct the parser produces (parse-shape) and the request the handler consumes
(runtime-shape) are **two different types**.

```text
+-------------------+     +-----------------+     +---------------+
|  CLI text input   | --> |   parse-shape   | --> |  runtime-shape|
| (argv, env, file) |     |  (WidgetArgs)   |     |   (Request)   |
+-------------------+     +-----------------+     +---------------+
                              ^                          ^
                              |                          |
                          parser-friendly:           domain-friendly:
                          strings, bools,            newtypes, parsed
                          Option<String>             enums, validated paths
```

The projection from parse-shape → runtime-shape happens once, at the top of each handler. This is
where you parse strings into newtypes, compile patterns, validate enums, and reject illegal flag
combinations.

After projection, downstream code **cannot represent an invalid state**. This is the "parse, don't
validate" principle made concrete (see [04 — Coding Style](./04-coding-style-rust-zig.md), rule 2).

---

## The four-edit rule for subcommands

Adding a new subcommand `widget` touches exactly four files:

1. `cli/widget.rs` — parse-shape struct.
2. `cli/<root>` — register the variant in the subcommand enum.
3. `commands/widget.rs` — handler (free `run` function).
4. `main.rs` (or the dispatch arm) — dispatch.

No registry macros, no auto-discovery, no plugin trait. Explicit dispatch over magic. The compiler
tells you when you forgot an arm.

**Anti-patterns** this rule prevents:

- Giant single `cli.rs` holding every parser struct. Makes diffs unreadable.
- Handler as a method on the args struct (`impl WidgetArgs { fn run(...) }`). Couples parse-shape to
  runtime, prevents the pure projection step.
- Per-command async-runtime construction. Build one runtime in `main`, share via `AppContext`.
- `Box<dyn Command>` registry. Loses exhaustive-match safety, adds nothing.

### When to extract a service

The default is: keep the work inline in `commands/widget.rs`. Extract `services/widget` only when
**at least one** is true:

1. Another command needs the same orchestration.
2. The pure core is non-trivial and you want to unit-test it without the parser.
3. The handler exceeds ~200 LOC.

Otherwise, inline. Premature service extraction creates passthrough wrappers that obscure the call
graph.

---

## Cross-cutting concerns (middleware, telemetry, hooks)

Pre/post-command interception, telemetry wrappers, retry/recovery decorators — these cut across
multiple commands. Place them by volume:

- **One or two hooks**: wrap the dispatch arm in `main.rs`. No new directory.
- **A reusable family** (telemetry, audit, rate limiting): define a `Middleware` trait in
  `adapters/`, with one impl per concern. Compose the chain in `context.rs` or at dispatch.
- **A dedicated `middleware/` directory**: only when the chain exceeds ~300 LOC or three independent
  concerns. Until then, `adapters/` is the right home — middleware is an infrastructure concern.

Do **not** decorate handlers inside `commands/`. That scatters cross-cutting policy across every
subcommand and breaks the four-edit rule.

---

## One `AppContext`, built once

```text
main()
  parse_cli() -> Cli
  init_logging(cli.verbosity)
  ctx = AppContext::new(cli.global)   <-- builds once
  dispatch(&ctx, cli.command)         <-- pass by reference
```

The context carries:

- `config: Arc<Config>` — resolved config (see [03](./03-config-precedence.md)).
- `paths: Paths` — computed (data dir, state dir, cache dir).
- `ui: Ui` — the only renderer for human-facing tools; machine-facing tools carry a structured
  output/protocol facility instead.
- `runtime: Handle` — shared async runtime, if any.
- `clock: Arc<dyn Clock>` — abstracts time for tests.
- (optionally) `tracing_root: tracing::Span`.

**No globals.** No process-wide `static`, no thread-locals, no implicit context. Commands take an
explicit `&AppContext`; tests construct one with fakes (`MockClock`, `InMemoryUi`).

---

## Crate organization: single → workspace

Start **single-crate, single-binary**. This is what `fd`, `gitui`, `ouch`, and `starship` do. Faster
compiles, zero workspace ceremony, lowest-friction shape for the first months of a project.

Migrate to a workspace only when **one** of these triggers fires (do not migrate proactively):

1. **Second binary sharing ≥30% of code.** A daemon, a helper, a TUI variant. Split into `app-core`
   (library) + `app-cli` (binary) + new consumer.
2. **A subsystem is publishable on its own.** `ripgrep` extracted `grep-matcher`, `grep-regex`,
   `grep-searcher`, `grep-printer` because each is reusable. If it has zero app-specific concerns,
   it earns its own crate.
3. **Compile time exceeds tolerance.** Incremental `check` over ~10 s and the slow code is
   structurally separable.
4. **Plugins/adapters need independent dep trees.** Helix splits `helix-lsp` so the LSP client's
   deps don't bloat the core.

**Hard threshold**: at ~8k LOC of application code, take a serious look. Below that, the cost of
workspace navigation outweighs the wins.

### Workspace shapes when you do migrate

- **Core lib + thin bin** (the `bat` pattern): `crates/app-core/` (library) + `crates/app-cli/` (the
  binary, depends on core).
- **Domain crates + glue** (the `ripgrep` pattern): `app-domain/`, `app-adapter-<system>/`,
  `app-service/`, `app-cli/`. Use when subsystems are publishable.

See [10 — Reference Projects](./10-reference-projects.md) for organizational patterns from
well-studied codebases.

### Directory rules across a workspace

The single-crate rules above still hold per-crate. Specifically:

- **Four-edit rule** stays scoped to whichever crate owns the binary; you still touch four files,
  just within that one crate.
- **`domain/` and `adapters/`** extract into `app-core` (or per-subsystem crates). `cli/` and
  `commands/` stay in the binary crate.
- **No cross-crate `cli/` imports.** Each binary owns its own parse-shape. Crates communicate via
  runtime-shape request types defined in `domain/`.
- **One `AppContext` per binary.** Don't share the struct across binaries — each may need different
  fields. If construction logic is shared, factor it as a builder in `app-core`.

---

## When to add a library file (`lib.rs` / `__init__.py` API)

Only when one of these is true:

1. Another consumer (a second crate, a Tauri app, a sibling binary) needs the same logic.
2. Integration tests need access to internals that aren't reachable from a binary-only crate.

A no-op library file that just declares private modules is dead weight. If you don't have a real
consumer, **don't** create the public surface — keep modules internal.
