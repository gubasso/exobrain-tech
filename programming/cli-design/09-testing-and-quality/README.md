# 08 — Testing & Quality

> Part of the general [CLI design principles](../README.md).

Testing strategy, per-language tooling, regression safeguards, and code quality gates. This chapter
covers **what** to test, **how** to test it, what tools to use, and how to prevent regressions from
both human and AI coding agents.

## Chapters

| Chapter                                             | Question it answers                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Testing strategy](./testing-strategy.md)           | "What does the test pyramid look like for a CLI? What goes in each tier? How do I keep tests isolated?"   |
| [Testing tools](./testing-tools.md)                 | "Which runner, snapshot library, property framework, and mutation tool should I use for my language?"     |
| [Regression safeguards](./regression-safeguards.md) | "How do I prevent AI agents (and humans) from introducing regressions? What's the verification workflow?" |
| [Code quality tools](./code-quality-tools.md)       | "Which tools enforce complexity limits, catch unused deps, track binary size, and guard architecture?"    |

Read in this order: strategy first (principles), then tools (implementation), then safeguards
(workflow), then quality tools (structural gates).

## When you need this chapter

- You are setting up tests for a new CLI project.
- You are reviewing or improving an existing test suite.
- You are integrating AI coding agents into your workflow and want guardrails.
- You need to add mutation testing, property-based testing, or complexity enforcement.
- You are configuring pre-commit / pre-push / CI quality gates.
