# Pure Types, Side-Effect Boundaries

> Why Parsing and I/O Belong Outside Your Domain Models (Lessons from Rust, Pydantic, and Functional
> Design)

Short answer: keep your domain types **pure and side-effect free**; put I/O (files, sockets, env) in
thin, external helpers. It’s fine (and ergonomic) for a type to expose **pure** (de)serialization
that works on in-memory data (str/bytes), but **file paths and readers/writers belong outside**.
This lines up with widely used architectural guidance (functional core/imperative shell, hexagonal),
Rust’s idioms (traits like `Serialize/Deserialize`, `FromStr`, `Display`, and `Read`/`Write`-based
APIs), and Pydantic v2’s model dump/validate APIs. ([Destroy All Software][1])

Here’s the reasoning, with concrete takeaways:

## Why keep types “dumb” about I/O

- **Testability & determinism.** Functional-core/imperative-shell recommends pushing side effects to
  the edges. Your “core” (domain types) is pure and easy to unit test; the “shell” does I/O and is
  integration-tested. ([Destroy All Software][1])
- **Architecture boundaries.** Hexagonal/ports-and-adapters keeps the domain independent of
  infrastructure (files, HTTP, DB). Your models shouldn’t know where bytes came from or where
  they’ll be stored. ([Code With Arho][2])
- **API ergonomics in Rust & beyond.** Idiomatic Rust code separates data representation from I/O:
  you implement parsing/formatting via traits and accept generic `Read`/`Write` streams for
  persistence—never hard-wire file paths into your types. ([Rust Documentation][3])

## What “idiomatic” looks like in Rust

- **Serialize/Deserialize with Serde** on the type; let _callers_ choose the format crate
  (`serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, etc.). The type stays format-agnostic and I/O-agnostic. ([Serde][4])
- **Parsing from strings**: implement `FromStr` (and/or `TryFrom<&str>`) so callers can do
  `"…".parse::<T>()`. Community guidance and clippy lean toward `FromStr` for actual parsing.
  ([Stack Overflow][5])
- **Formatting to strings**: implement `Display` (and `ToString` comes for free). Keep filesystem
  access in separate functions that take `impl Read/Write` to maximize reuse and testability.
  ([GitHub][6])

## What “idiomatic” looks like in Python with Pydantic v2

- Use **pure** conversions on the model: `model.model_dump()` / `model.model_dump_json()` and
  `Model.model_validate(...)` / `Model.model_validate_json(...)`. These are side-effect free and
  align with the library’s intended usage. ([Pydantic][7])
- Keep **file I/O** in helpers (e.g., `load_active_products(fp: TextIO)` /
  `save_active_products(fp: TextIO, ap: ActiveProducts)`) so tests can pass `io.StringIO` or temp
  files. This mirrors Rust’s `Read`/`Write` style abstractions for better test isolation.
  ([Rust Documentation][3])
- If you want YAML support, it’s fine to provide **string-level** helpers on the type
  (`to_yaml_str()` / `from_yaml_str()`), but prefer file handling outside. Pydantic doesn’t ship
  YAML itself; this separation keeps the model decoupled from optional dependencies. ([Pydantic][7])

## A pragmatic compromise (what great codebases do)

1. **Domain types** expose **string/bytes** conversions (pure):

   - Python: `to_yaml_str()`, `from_yaml_str()`, `model_dump_json()`, `model_validate_json()` (no
     file access). ([Pydantic][7])
   - Rust: `impl Serialize/Deserialize`, `impl FromStr`, `impl Display`. ([Serde][4])

2. **Adapters/services** own **I/O**:

   - Python: `load_from_yaml(path | fp)` / `save_to_yaml(path | fp)` live in a `io_/persistence`
     module and accept file-like objects for testing.
   - Rust: `fn read_from<R: Read>(r: R) -> Result<T, _>` /
     `fn write_to<W: Write>(w: W, value: &T) -> Result<(), _>`. ([Rust Documentation][3])

3. **Optional convenience** methods on the model (e.g., `ActiveProducts.save(path)`): if you keep
   them, make them **thin wrappers** that delegate to the adapter. This preserves the clean
   separation while remaining ergonomic.

### TL;DR

- **Best practice:** _Types stay pure; I/O lives outside._
- **Allow on-type helpers** that work with in-memory data (str/bytes) only.
- **Use traits/standard APIs** for parsing/formatting and generic I/O (Rust’s
  `Serialize/Deserialize`, `FromStr`/`Display`; Python’s Pydantic `model_dump`/`model_validate` and
  file-like objects). This approach gives you maximal testability, portability, and composability
  while keeping ergonomics high. ([Destroy All Software][1])

If you want, I can refactor your `ActiveProducts` to this pattern (string-level methods on the
class + small `io.py` with file/stream helpers).
