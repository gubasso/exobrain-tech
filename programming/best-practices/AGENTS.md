# AGENTS

## Scope

Cross-cutting best practices for licensing, ADR templates, operational responsibilities, pre-commit
hooks, refactor and migration guidance, refusal lists, and spec-driven development practices.

## Key Points

- **Licensing**: SPDX defaults for code and docs.
- **MADR template**: decision-record structure and when to write one.
- **Operational responsibilities**: DevOps checklist for ongoing ownership.
- **Pre-commit**: hook configuration guidance.
- **Refactor guidance**: migration guideline, excerpt, plan templates, and refusal list.
- **Spec-driven development**: best-practice notes for spec-first work.
