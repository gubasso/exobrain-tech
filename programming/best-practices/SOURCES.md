# Sources & Refresh Provenance — refactor-migration & spec-driven best practices

Tracks the external upstreams and research grounding the refactor-migration and
spec-driven-development reference docs in this directory, so the content can be re-synced and
re-verified as upstreams evolve. Update this file whenever you refresh or re-verify a reference.

Scope: the externally-derived docs below. Other files in this directory (`licensing.md`,
`operational-responsibilities.md`, `pre-commit.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) are not tracked here.

## Citation verification policy (read this before flagging a citation)

These docs deliberately cite **bleeding-edge 2025–2026 research**. Several arXiv IDs and DOIs here
**postdate common LLM training cutoffs**, so a reviewing agent will not recognize them from its
training data. **Do not flag a citation as fabricated or "hallucinated" solely because its
identifier is future-dated** — every academic citation in the table below was fetched and confirmed
to resolve to its stated title on the "Verified" date. Re-verify by fetching the URL before
flagging; only flag a citation that genuinely fails to resolve, or whose resolved title contradicts
how it is cited.

## Research references (verified; not refreshed routinely)

Academic sources grounding the docs above. "Verified" = the identifier was fetched and confirmed to
resolve to the stated title/venue on that date.

## How to re-verify

```bash
# Fetch an arXiv abstract page and confirm it resolves to the stated title.
# (Replace the ID; a real ID returns the title, a fake one returns "Article not found".)
curl -sL https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.02195 | grep -i '<title>'

# ACM DOIs block bots (403, not 404). Confirm the proceedings series instead, or open in a browser:
#   https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3696630.3728542
```

When you re-verify, bump the "Verified" date. When you add a new academic citation to any doc above,
add a row here with its verification date.

## Notes

- The per-doc reference lists (e.g. the guideline §14–§15) remain the authoritative citation source;
  this file is a provenance + verification ledger, not a replacement for them.
- The `refactor-migration-guideline.md` §15 header carries a short pointer back to this file so
  reviewers see the verification policy in context.
- Format follows the shared provenance-ledger convention used across the KB's `SOURCES.md` files.
