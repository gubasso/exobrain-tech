# 07 — Plan and Slices

[01 — Diataxis Zones](./01-diataxis-zones.md) adds a plan zone for what is next.
[06 — Appetite and Scope](./06-appetite-and-scope.md) says what bounds a unit of work inside it. This
chapter says what documents the zone holds and what shape the unit of work takes on disk.

The shape is deliberately small. Every artifact has to survive one question: what does a reader or an
agent session lose if this file does not exist? Anything that fails that question is ceremony, and
ceremony is indistinguishable from diligence until you count.

## The plan zone's documents

```text
<project>/docs/plan/
  charter.md         What the project is for, its pillars, and its no-gos. Two pages at most.
                     Written once, revised per release, never per slice.
  milestones.md      The ordered slices, one row each, with a status. The single status surface:
                     a reader consults this and nothing else to know where the work stands.
  open-questions.md  Questions that could change a decision, and what each one blocks.
  slices/            One directory per unit of work.
```

`charter.md` and `milestones.md` are the only documents a reader consults without a slice in hand. Keep
both short enough that they are read rather than skimmed. Use the drop-in
[plan-zone template](./template-plan-zone.md) for all three.

### `milestones.md`

One row per slice, ordered, with a closed status vocabulary:

```text
| id  | slice                  | status | appetite | note                          |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| 006 | password-reset-email   | done   | 2 passes |                               |
| 007 | rate-limit-login       | active | 3 passes |                               |
| 008 | audit-log-export       | shaped | 2 passes |                               |
| 005 | bulk-import            | cut    | 2 passes | remainder cut, core shipped   |
| 004 | session-store          | reshaped | 1 pass | re-shaped as 009              |
```

- `shaped` — the slice document is committed and the work has not started.
- `active` — implementation is in progress.
- `done` — the named tests pass unskipped.
- `cut` — the slice shipped its core and its remainder was cut. This is a success, not a failure.
- `reshaped` — the work was stopped uphill and re-shaped; the note names the successor id.

`milestones.md` SHOULD derive whatever it can from the slices themselves so it cannot silently disagree
with them. A status surface maintained by hand goes stale between the moment the work changes and the
moment someone remembers.

The slice document carries no status of its own, deliberately. Two status surfaces disagree, and the
one a reader did not open is the one that is wrong. A reader holding a slice finds its status one grep
away in `milestones.md`.

### `open-questions.md`

One block per question, with a stable id so a slice or a commit can reference it:

```text
## Q-003 — Does the rate limiter need to survive a restart?

Blocks: 007 acceptance line 2.
Raised: while shaping 007.
Exit: ADR, decision on persistence.
```

`Blocks` names what the question holds up and is mandatory; an entry that blocks nothing is a note, and
notes belong in the drafts workspace. Every entry leaves by exactly one of three exits: it becomes an
ADR, it becomes a line in the slice under `Revisions`, or it is recorded as measured and closed.

The register is a triage desk, not a queue. The failure mode it guards against is becoming a place
discovery goes to be filed rather than acted on — a plan that always wins because the thing that would
have changed it was moved to another document. If questions accumulate faster than they exit, the
shaping is wrong, not the register.

## One directory per slice

A slice is one directory, always, whatever its size:

```text
<project>/docs/plan/slices/<id>-<slug>/
  README.md         Always. The entry document.
  tasks.md          Only when implementation will cross a context reset.
  requirements.md   Only when acceptance maps many-to-many onto tests.
```

`<id>` is a zero-padded sequential number, `001` onward, matching the `ADR-NNNN` and `KI-NNNN` schemes
so ids read cleanly in commit messages and grep alike. Ids are never reused and never renumbered: a
re-shaped slice takes the next free id rather than the old one, so the two remain separately
addressable.

The directory is the default rather than an escalation because escalation has a cost of its own. A slice
that starts as `slices/<id>-<slug>.md` and later needs a second file must be renamed, and the rename
breaks every reference already pointing at it — the milestone row, the open questions, the commit
messages. That happens exactly when the work is already in trouble, which is when a restructuring step
is least likely to be taken. A directory that grows a file costs nothing and breaks nothing.

`README.md` is the entry document. The name is deliberate: forges render it when a reader opens the
directory, so the human entry point and the agent entry point are the same file.

The additional files are gated, and the gates are prohibitions rather than permissions:

- `tasks.md` MUST NOT exist unless implementation will cross a context reset. Its job is durable state
  across a boundary that erases working memory. Inside a single session the ordered work is already in
  the session.
- `requirements.md` MUST NOT exist unless acceptance maps many-to-many onto tests, or spans more than
  one test lane, so a flat list in `README.md` can no longer be audited by reading it.
- `design.md` MUST NOT exist. Current subsystem design is owned by the explanation zone; see
  [03 — Subsystem Pages](./03-subsystem-pages.md).

State them this way because a slice directory looks like an invitation to fill it. Tools trained on
other spec-driven workflows will produce a full set of files unprompted, and a positive rule does not
survive that pull as well as a negative one.

The signal that the gates have failed is countable rather than felt: a run of slices whose `tasks.md`
restates what `README.md` already said. Look for it during review, not per slice — one slice never looks
like ceremony from the inside.

### `tasks.md`, when its gate is met

A flat ordered checklist and nothing else. One line per task, each a concrete action a session can
finish and check off:

```text
- [x] Add the token bucket to `RateLimiter`.
- [x] Wire the 429 response path.
- [ ] Backfill `test_rate_limit_429`.
- [ ] Remove the temporary in-memory store.
```

It carries no goal, no scope, no acceptance criteria, and no rationale — `README.md` owns all four, and
restating them is the failure signal above. It is working state, not a record: it is deleted with the
slice's `done` transition rather than kept as history, because the commits are the history.

### `requirements.md`, when its gate is met

The `Acceptance` lines expanded to a table mapping each assertion to the tests that prove it, in the
same EARS phrasing. It replaces the flat list in `README.md`; the two MUST NOT both carry acceptance.

## The slice document

`README.md` has a fixed heading list, which a project SHOULD pin with markdownlint's
`MD043 required-heading-structure` so it cannot drift into a second charter:

```text
Goal          One sentence naming the observable outcome. Not the mechanism.
Appetite      The fixed budget, in the project's chosen unit. See chapter 06.
Core          The non-negotiable outcome this slice guarantees. Never cut.
In scope      The negotiable remainder, ordered so the least valuable is cut first.
Out of scope  Explicit no-gos for this slice.
Governed by   Every source a session must load, named individually.
Acceptance    One line per assertion, each naming the test that proves it.
Rabbit holes  Known traps, each with a pre-authorized escape.
Done when     The objective completion condition.
Revisions     One line per change to this document after the work started.
```

`Core` and `In scope` are separate headings because
[06 — Appetite and Scope](./06-appetite-and-scope.md) requires the non-negotiable outcome to be declared
apart from the remainder that funds it. Collapsing them into one scope list is the everything-is-core
anti-pattern with better formatting.

`Out of scope` does more work than its length suggests. It is the only heading that constrains by
subtraction, and it is what stops a session from helpfully building the adjacent thing.

Use the drop-in [slice template](./template-slice.md).

## Governed by is the context filter

An agent session loads `README.md` and the sources `Governed by` names. Nothing else. This is the
concrete form of the one-entry-document rule in [04 — Agent Context](./04-agent-context.md), and it
works because it names sources instead of describing them.

A `Governed by` entry that names a whole directory is a defect. If the session needs the directory, the
slice is too large; if it needs three files in it, name the three. The general principle is that context
is a finite budget, spent well by carrying lightweight identifiers and resolving them at load time
rather than preloading everything that might matter; see
<https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents>.

## Acceptance lines and EARS

Each `Acceptance` line states one assertion and names the test that proves it:

```text
When a client exceeds 5 login attempts in 60 seconds, the system shall respond 429.
  -> test_rate_limit_429
```

The assertions are phrased in EARS, the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax — a constrained template
for requirements, first published in 2009 by Alistair Mavin and colleagues at Rolls-Royce, and used at
Airbus, Bosch, Dyson, Honeywell, Intel, NASA, Rolls-Royce and Siemens. Five patterns plus their
combination:

| Pattern            | Template                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ubiquitous         | The `<system>` shall `<response>`.                                           |
| State driven       | While `<precondition>`, the `<system>` shall `<response>`.                   |
| Event driven       | When `<trigger>`, the `<system>` shall `<response>`.                         |
| Optional feature   | Where `<feature is included>`, the `<system>` shall `<response>`.            |
| Unwanted behaviour | If `<trigger>`, then the `<system>` shall `<response>`.                      |
| Complex            | While `<precondition>`, when `<trigger>`, the `<system>` shall `<response>`. |

The value is that the opening keyword declares which kind of requirement follows before the content is
read, and that the unwanted-behaviour pattern gives error cases a named slot instead of leaving them to
be remembered. It is the same discipline as the uppercase keywords in
[10 — Lean Markdown](./10-lean-markdown.md), one level up: normativity carried by a fixed vocabulary
rather than by tone.

Two honest limits. EARS constrains phrasing, not correctness — a precisely phrased wrong requirement
passes. And the requirement-to-test naming above is not part of EARS; the official notation says nothing
about testability. It is borrowed from safety-critical traceability practice, and it carries that
practice's failure mode: a named test that does not exist yet is a forward reference that goes stale
silently when a test is renamed.

So a project that names tests in acceptance lines MUST also carry a hook that fails when a named test
cannot be found. Without the hook, drop the naming and keep the assertions — an unenforced reference is
worse than none, because it reads as verified.

## The pre-production gate

One line in the project's author-instructions file:

```text
Until the current slice is implemented, do not add a specification page and do not open an ADR
outside that slice. A question that arises goes to docs/plan/open-questions.md.
```

This is the circuit breaker on documentation itself. Without it a project specifies indefinitely,
because specifying is cheaper than building and always feels productive. It is worth more than any
choice about file layout.

The gate binds agents in particular. A session that hits an undecided question will decide it, write the
record, and continue — producing a decision nobody made.

## A slice is a bet, not a contract

The slice document is committed before the work starts. Committed at the end it is a report; committed
at the start it is the thing later commits are read against.

It is not frozen by being committed. Google's design-doc practice is explicit that a document should be
updated when what it describes has not shipped yet, which is exactly a slice's condition for its whole
life; see <https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/>. A plan that cannot absorb
what implementation taught is a plan that quietly stops being read.

The revision rule is the same one [06 — Appetite and Scope](./06-appetite-and-scope.md) applies to the
appetite. A change to `Goal`, `Core`, `Appetite`, or `Acceptance` after the work has started MUST be a
committed edit that adds one line under `Revisions` naming what changed and what was learned that
changed it. Cutting the remainder is not a revision; it is the designed response to a binding appetite
and needs no ceremony beyond the commit that does it.

That keeps both properties at once. The plan can move, so it stays true; every movement is in a diff, so
a project that routinely rewrites its slices mid-flight can see that it does. An unrecorded revision is
the only kind that teaches nothing.

## When a slice ends

The directory stays where it is. It is the artifact later commits were read against, and deleting it
removes the only record of what was promised before the work started.

- Finished: the milestone row flips to `done`, `tasks.md` is deleted if it existed, and the durable
  results migrate to the zones that own them — the design to a subsystem page, the choices to ADRs,
  exact values to reference. The plan keeps only the pointer.
- Cut: the row reads `cut` and the note names what was cut. The `In scope` list is left as written; it
  is the record of what was traded, and editing it after the fact erases that.
- Re-shaped: the row reads `reshaped` and names the successor id. The successor is a new directory with
  a new appetite; the old slice's `Revisions` carries one line saying the work was stopped uphill.

## Anti-patterns

- Slice as second charter: project-wide context restated in a unit of work. That is `charter.md`.
- Slice as design document: how a subsystem is built, written where what to build belongs. That is the
  explanation zone.
- Slice as decision record: a choice made in the slice instead of an ADR, so it is invisible to every
  future reader who does not read this slice.
- Directory filled by default: `tasks.md` and `requirements.md` created because the shape suggested
  them.
- `tasks.md` restating `README.md`: goal, scope, or acceptance copied into the checklist.
- `Governed by` naming a directory, a whole zone, or "the docs".
- Acceptance lines with no test named, or naming tests no hook verifies.
- Rabbit holes listed without escapes, which records a risk without doing anything about it.
- Silent revision: `Goal` or `Core` changes and `Revisions` does not.
- Status in two places: a `Status` heading in the slice competing with the milestone row.
- Open questions as an archive: entries that name nothing they block and never exit.
- Milestones maintained by hand until they disagree with the slices they summarize.
