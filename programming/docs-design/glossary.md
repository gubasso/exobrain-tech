# Glossary

One descriptive sentence per term this shelf uses, each naming the chapter whose rules govern it. An
entry identifies a term; it never states a rule, threshold, condition, or procedure.

A chapter defines a term inline only when the term is that chapter's subject. A chapter that uses a
term it does not own MUST NOT redefine it; it may add a short appositive for the immediate sentence,
and links `./glossary.md` when a reader might not know the term at all. If an entry here needs a
second sentence, the definition belongs in the owning chapter instead.
