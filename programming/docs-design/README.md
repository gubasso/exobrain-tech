# Documentation Design

Language-agnostic principles for organizing a software project's `docs/` directory. Use this shelf
when a project needs clear document ownership, lean decision records, operational docs that are easy
to find, and source-of-truth rules that humans and LLM agents can follow.

The pattern uses Diataxis zones, lean ADRs, single-source-of-truth placement, load-bearing comments,
gitignored drafts, and tracking for perishable facts. It is intentionally small: enough structure to
prevent drift, not enough to turn documentation into a separate process.

## How to use this shelf

1. Read [00 — Overview](./00-overview.md) for the defaults and when to apply them.
2. Apply the zone map from [01 — Diataxis Zones](./01-diataxis-zones.md).
3. Copy [template-adr.md](./template-adr.md) into `<project>/docs/decisions/template.md`.
4. Enforce the lean ADR rules from [02 — Lean ADRs](./02-lean-adrs.md).
5. Use [99 — Checklist](./99-checklist.md) before merging documentation changes.

LLM agents should load [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) first for the digest, then read the source chapters
that own the current change.

For a new project, start small. Create only the zones that have real content, but keep the same
placement rules. Empty structure is not the goal; predictable ownership is.

For an existing project, migrate by ownership. Move decisions first, then operational guides and
reference material. Leave broad explanation until the factual sources of truth are clear.

## Defaults

- Put decisions in `<project>/docs/decisions/`.
- Put task docs and runbooks in `<project>/docs/guides/`.
- Put lookup, diagnostics, and case studies in `<project>/docs/reference/`.
- Put architecture overviews and conceptual background in `<project>/docs/explanation/`.
- Keep filled ADRs at or below 350 words.
- Never delete accepted decisions; supersede or reject them.
- Keep drafts in `<project>/.draft/` or another gitignored workspace.
- Write each durable fact once and cross-link from everywhere else.
- Track bugs in external systems under test as known-issue cases under
  `<project>/docs/reference/known-issues/`; expand while hot, collapse to one summary when resolved.
- Track perishable facts in a machine-readable registry with a cadence and a `last_checked` date.
- Keep code comments load-bearing: rationale, invariants, boundary conditions, and links to owning
  decisions.
- Keep agent digests derived from source chapters; never let the digest become the source of truth.
- Keep the root docs README as navigation. If it starts carrying decisions, procedures, or
  diagnostic facts, move those facts to the owning zone and link back.
- Let the filesystem own structure: index files (README/AGENTS) explain purpose; they never
  replicate the directory tree.
