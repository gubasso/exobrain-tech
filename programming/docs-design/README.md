# Documentation Design

Language-agnostic principles for organizing a software project's `docs/` directory: clear document
ownership, lean decision records, operational docs that are easy to find, a plan zone for what is next,
and source-of-truth rules that humans and LLM agents can both follow. It is intentionally small —
enough structure to prevent drift, not enough to turn documentation into a separate process.

## Problem

Most project documentation decays for predictable reasons. A rule starts in a design note, gets copied
into a README, is restated in an onboarding guide, and then changes in only one place. A draft records
useful reasoning but never becomes a decision. A troubleshooting page grows into a mixed bag of
runbooks, diagnostics, background, and stale conclusions. Eventually readers stop trusting the docs and
fall back to guessing from code, chat history, or old issues.

The cure is not more ceremony. It is a small set of homes with clear ownership: each fact has one
source of truth, each document serves one reader need, and each decision stays short enough to be
reviewed, indexed, and superseded when it stops being true.

## Reading

Read the chapters in number order. Ownership comes before location, so the zone chapter can be a
placement map rather than a re-argument; the frozen record and the living description are adjacent
because their whole doctrine is the contrast between them; the agent constraint precedes the process
chapters that build on it; and style, the one document shape that is a guide's rather than a record's,
and the review gate come last, applied to material you already know how to produce.

An agent should not read the shelf linearly. Load [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md), find the owning chapter in
its routing table, and read that chapter plus the sources it names — the corpus load is exactly what
[04 — Agent Context](./04-agent-context.md) forbids.

## Adopting this shelf

Copy [template-docs-rules.md](./template-docs-rules.md) into the project's author-instructions file,
take the layout from [01 — Diataxis Zones](./01-diataxis-zones.md), copy
[template-adr.md](./template-adr.md), add [template-slice.md](./template-slice.md) and
[template-plan-zone.md](./template-plan-zone.md) if the project plans before it builds, and use
[99 — Checklist](./99-checklist.md) at review time.

For a new project, start small: create only the zones that have real content and keep the same
placement rules. Empty structure is not the goal; predictable ownership is. For an existing project,
migrate by ownership — decisions first, then operational guides and reference material, leaving broad
explanation until the factual sources of truth are clear.

Apply this to any project with a `docs/` directory, more than one maintainer, recurring design
decisions, operational procedures, or an agent in the loop. Do not spend time on it for a throwaway
spike with no readers beyond the author, do not create empty directories to signal maturity, and do not
write an ADR for a choice that a type name already expresses. If applying it creates more documents
than the project can keep truthful, shrink the inventory and keep the placement rules.

## House format

The markdown rules are [10 — Lean Markdown](./10-lean-markdown.md), which this shelf obeys. What is
specific to the shelf's own layout:

- Frontmatter: only `AGENTS.md` carries it.
- One `#` per file. `##` for sections, `###` only for genuinely parallel sub-parts. Never `####`.
- An unheaded opening of two to four sentences states what the file owns, then normative sections, then
  `## Anti-patterns` where the chapter has failure modes, then `## Sources`.
- No `## See also`. This table and inline links are the navigation.
- Paragraphs carry one point, normally three sentences or fewer.
- Cite inline at the claim when one claim uses a source; a trailing `## Sources` block only where a
  chapter carries three or more. A URL appears in two chapters only when each supports a different
  claim.
- In-shelf links take the form `[NN — Title](./NN-slug.md)`.
- `<angle>` placeholders for anything project-specific; no real project name appears in the shelf.
- Hand-wrap at 100 columns; the formatter maintains wrapping rather than reflowing it.
