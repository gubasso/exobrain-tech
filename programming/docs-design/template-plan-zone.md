Copy each block below into the named file under `<project>/docs/plan/`. Create only the documents the
project actually maintains; an empty charter is worse than no charter. The slice entry document has its
own template — see [template-slice.md](./template-slice.md). Rules for all three are in
[07 — Plan and Slices](./07-plan-and-slices.md).

## `charter.md`

```markdown
# <project> — Charter

## What this is for

<Two or three sentences. The outcome the project exists to produce, not the mechanism.>

## Pillars

- <A property every slice is judged against.>
- <Another.>

## No-gos

- <Something this project will not do, and the reason.>
- <Another.>

## Appetite unit

<Calendar time | human review passes | implementation sessions.> One unit, kept for the project's life.
```

Two pages at most. Revised per release, never per slice.

## `milestones.md`

```markdown
# Milestones

The single status surface. A reader consults this and nothing else to know where the work stands.

| id  | slice  | status | appetite | note |
| --- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ---- |
| 001 | <slug> | done   | <n>      |      |
| 002 | <slug> | active | <n>      |      |
| 003 | <slug> | shaped | <n>      |      |

Status is one of `shaped`, `active`, `done`, `cut`, or `reshaped`. A `reshaped` row names its
successor id in the note. A `cut` row names what was cut.
```

Derive whatever can be derived from the slices themselves so this cannot silently disagree with them.

## `open-questions.md`

```markdown
# Open questions

Triage, not a queue. Every entry names what it blocks and leaves by one of three exits: an ADR, a
`Revisions` line in a slice, or a recorded measurement.

## Q-001 — <the question, as a question>

Blocks: <the slice id and heading, the decision, or the acceptance line this holds up>.
Raised: <when and in what context>.
Exit: <ADR | slice revision | measurement>, <what specifically closes it>.
```

An entry that blocks nothing is a note, and notes belong in the drafts workspace; see
[05 — Drafts and Promotion](./05-drafts-and-promotion.md).
