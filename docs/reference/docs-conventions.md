# Documentation conventions

How `exobrain-tech` organizes and maintains the specs about its knowledge-base product. The goal is a
small set of homes with clear ownership: each fact has one durable source of truth, each document
serves one reader need, each decision stays short enough to review and supersede.

Sources: <https://diataxis.fr/> and
<https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/>.

## Diataxis zones

Place a document by the reader need it serves:

- **`decisions/`** — why a choice was made. Lean ADRs.
- **`guides/`** — how to complete a task. Runbooks and procedures.
- **`reference/`** — exact facts for lookup. Conventions, schemas, diagnostics, case studies.
- **`explanation/`** — how a subsystem fits together. Architecture and background.

Zone comes first, topic second: `docs/reference/<topic>/`, not `docs/<topic>/reference.md`. A
top-level topic folder mixes reader needs and forces readers to infer intent from prose. If a
document needs two homes, choose the owner and link from the other.

## Lean ADRs

Architecture decisions live in `decisions/` as lean ADRs. A useful ADR names the problem, lists the
serious options, records the chosen option, states consequences, and declares status. Keep a filled
ADR body at or below 350 words; if it cannot fit, it is probably multiple decisions — split them.

Lifecycle: `Proposed → Accepted → Implemented → Superseded | Rejected`. **Never delete an accepted
decision.** If it becomes wrong, mark it `Superseded` and link forward; keep a `Rejected` option
when the rejection prevents repeated debate. Copy `decisions/template.md` to start a new ADR.

## Single source of truth

Write each durable fact once at its owning home and link from everywhere else. Restatement drifts.
A README points to the ADR; a guide links to a reference page; a digest summarizes an area but the
area's files stay authoritative. Resolve a conflict by editing the non-owner to link to the owner.

Let the filesystem own structure. The directory listing is the source of truth for what exists;
index files (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) explain a directory's _purpose_ — its domains, concepts, and
rules — and never maintain a parallel copy of the file tree, which drifts the moment a file is added
or renamed. When a listing genuinely aids discovery, give each entry a purpose
(`- [docker](./docker.md) — daemon setup and daily commands`), not a bare path the filesystem already
shows. The one exception is a block a tool regenerates from the tree — an auto-generated table of
contents — where the generator, not a human, owns the copy and keeps it in sync.

## Drafts

Drafts live outside the shipped tree, normally under a gitignored `.draft/`. Promotion rewrites a
draft into its durable zone and then deletes the draft. Split a mixed draft by reader need before
promoting. No draft is the only home for a real decision.

## AGENTS.md digests

Each substantial content area carries an `AGENTS.md` digest — a map of that area, loaded first,
derived from the area's files, never the source of truth. It declares its sources and a
`last-synced` date so staleness is visible, and is regenerated when a source changes. See
[AGENTS.md digest template](./agents-digest-template.md) and
[Knowledge-base architecture](../explanation/knowledge-base-architecture.md).

## Semantic names and stable headings

Filenames and headings are retrieval hints for humans and agents alike. Expose purpose before the
file is opened: `<topic>-diagnostics.md`, `<subsystem>-architecture.md`, `<task>-runbook.md`. Use
consistent vocabulary across files. Prefer direct headings (`## Placement rules`, `## Verification`)
over clever prose.

## Tracking perishable facts

A fact that expires — a price, benchmark, model roster, or external API shape — carries an owner, a
revalidation cadence, and a `last_checked` date in a small machine-readable registry. The tracked
artifact stays the source of truth; the registry keeps it from going stale.
